<p align="center" style="text-align: center" class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU"><font size="4"><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/kasem/index.html">Abul Kasem</a></font></span></p>

<h2><font color="#800080"><span style="font-weight: 400">Introduction</span></font></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">This guide is a compilation of contradictory verses in the Qur'an, the holiest book of Islam. Muslims consider the Qur'an as the infallible words of Allah, free of any ambiguities, contradictions, errors and irrationalities. This guide will demonstrate that far from being perfect, free of ambiguities and errors, the Qur'an is replete with hundreds of contradictory statements that will surprise the critical readers of the Qur'an. It is unbelievable that an omnipotent, omniscient, all‑knowing, and all‑powerful Allah will have such a demented intellect to construct so many contradictory passages.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For easy understanding, the Qur'anic verses are provided in summarized, plain English. For the complete translation please refer to the translations of Yusuf Ali, Picthal, and Shakir:
(<a href="https://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/reference/reference.html" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/reference/reference.html</a>) or the translation of Hilali and Khan (<a href="https://www.mlivo.com/translations/Hilali%20Khan.htm" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">https://www.mlivo.com/translations/Hilali%20Khan.htm</a>).

<p class="MsoNormal">Many contradictory verses are repeated; it is because of the repetitive nature of the Qur'an. One amazing aspect of the Qur'an is that there may be several contradictions in a single verse.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Please note that this guide does not address Qur'an's errors, absurdities, and irrationalities on various subjects such as science, mathematics, astronomy, history, embryology, geology, and cosmology. This is a vast topic and a separate guide is necessary to understand Allah's expertise on these issues.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This guide may not be complete. There might be many other contradictory verses which the author might have missed. The author will appreciate if any reader finds other contradictory verses not included in this guide, and brings them to my attention. I shall include them in the list to make this guide as comprehensive as possible.</p>


<h2><span style="font-weight: 400"><font color="#800080">Sura 2: al-Baqara (The Cow)</font></span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:21
</strong>Allah created the mankind; they should worship Him.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 3:97, 35:15 say Allah does not need mankind and the jinns; He is free of all want.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:29
</strong>Allah created the earth (first) then He perfected the seven firmaments (heavens); He has the perfect knowledge of all things. (This verse indicates that Allah started creation by creating earth, and then He made heaven into seven heavens. This is how building usually starts, with the lower floors first and then the top floors—ibn Kathir).
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 79:27‑30 says Allah created the heavens first.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:34
</strong>All the angels bowed to Adam, except Iblis. He was haughty and a disbeliever.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 16:49 says every creature in the heavens and in earth prostrates to Allah.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:35
</strong>Allah forbade Adam and his wife to approach the tree of knowledge. (Allah spoke directly to Adam—ibn Kathir.)
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 42:51 says Allah never speaks directly to a human; He speaks either from behind a veil or through a messenger.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:37
</strong>Adam learned the words of inspiration from Allah. Adam was the first Muslim.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 2:131 says Abraham was the first Muslim.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 6:14 says Muhammad was the first Muslim.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 7:143 says Moses was the first Muslim.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 26:51 says some Egyptians were the first Muslims.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:38
</strong>Allah ordered Adam and his wife to descend on earth, and to preach on people whatever message they received from Allah.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: In verse 20:123, before sending Adam on earth, Allah told him humans on earth would be enemies of one another. This means there were already people on earth when Adam descended on it. So Adam was not the first human created by Allah.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:47
</strong>Allah blesses the Children of Israel more than other believers; He has preferred them above all beings.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 3:33‑34 says Allah preferred Adam, Noah, the house of Abraham, and the house of Imran above all beings.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:50
</strong>Allah parted the sea (Red sea); saved the Children of Israel (i.e., Moses' people), and drowned Pharaoh in front of the eyes of the Children of Israel.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 10:90 says Pharaoh submitted to Islam.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 10:92 says Allah saved Pharaoh.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:51
</strong>When Moses went to keep his appointment with Allah for forty days, his people reverted to worshipping a cow during his absence.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 7:142 says Moses' appointment with Allah was for forty nights.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:52
</strong>Despite their sins of idolatry, Allah forgave the people of Moses.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 2:63 says Allah raised the Mount Sinai above the Children of Israel and threatened them to submit to Him.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 7:152 says Allah punished them.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:58
</strong>Then Allah asked the people of Moses to humbly enter a city (Jerusalem or Jericho—ibn Kathir) through its gate so that they could find all the provisions they needed for their sustenance.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction: </span>Allah says in 7:137 He let Moses' people inherit the land east and west, that is, the land of greater Syria.

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:62
</strong>Muslims/Jews/Christians/Sabians—anyone who believes in Allah and the last Day and does a righteous deed will get rewards.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 9:17 says unbelievers will go to hell.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> In 3:85 Allah says He only accepts Islam.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 4:150‑151 says Allah will severely punish those who deny Allah and Muhammad and those who separate Allah from His messengers.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> in 5:33 Allah commands Muslims to Crucify or behead those who criticize Islam and Muhammad or do not convert to Islam.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:79
</strong>Those Jews wrote their Book with their own hands, and faked that as the Book from Allah, Allah curses them.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 6:34, 6:115 say <strong>none</strong> has the power to change the words of Allah.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:106
</strong>Whatever verses Allah abrogates or causes Muhammad to forget, He replaces them with similar or better verses (Muhammad did forget some Qur'anic verses—Walker, p. 166).
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 6:34, 6:115 say <strong>none</strong> can change the words in the Qur'an.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:107
</strong>The dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs to Allah; there is no protector besides Him.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: In 13:11, 41:31, 50:17‑18, and 82:10 Allah says angels are our protectors and guards.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 5:55 says Allah's messengers are our protectors.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:116
</strong>The Christians belief that Allah had begotten a son is untrue; Allah possesses everything in heavens and on earth, everything worships Him.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 3:180, 15:23, 19:40, 19:79‑80, 21:89, 28:58 say Allah inherits from infidels/other creatures.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:117
</strong>Allah creates instantly, by decree; He says 'be' and it is.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 7:54, 10:3, 11:7 and 25:59 say six days of creation.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 41:9–12 say eight days of creation.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 6:101 says Allah could not create a son for himself because He does not have a consort (a wife or a concubine).


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:131
</strong>Allah asked, and Abraham cheerfully submitted himself to Allah (Abraham was the first Muslim—ibn Kathir.)
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 2:37 says Adam was the first Muslim.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 6:14 says Muhammad was the first Muslim.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 7:143 says Moses was the first Muslim.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 26:51 says some Egyptians were the first Muslims.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:139
</strong>The Islamic, the Jewish and the Christian Allah is the same Allah, do not argue on this. Allah will reward each group according to their deeds.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 9:30 says Jews and Christians are idolaters.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 3:118, 5:51, 5:57, 58:14 and 60:13 say not to be friendly with unbelievers, including Jews and the Christians.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:148
</strong>Every nation has a qibla; Allah has given each group of people a law and a way of life.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 25:51 says if willed, Allah could have sent messengers to every nation to instill fear; but He didn't.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:167
</strong>Those who plead for another chance, Allah will disown them and send them to hell to dwell there forever.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 6:128 says as long as Allah wishes, not forever.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:185
</strong>As a guide to mankind, Allah sent the Qur'an in the month of Ramadan (the ENTIRE Qur'an).
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction: </span>17:106, 25:32 say Allah sent the Qur'an in stages.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:219
</strong>Wines and gambling are Satan's handiwork—there are some good but great sins.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 47:15 and 83:25 say Allah will serve Satan's handiwork, wine, in Islamic Paradise.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:221
</strong>Do not marry idolatresses until they believe. A believing slave woman is better than a non-believing free woman; do not get your girls married to unbelievers until they (the unbelievers) convert to Islam.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 9:30 says the Jews and the Christians are idolaters, but Allah allows Muslim men to marry their women without converting to Islam. According to ibn Abbas, 'I do not know of a bigger Shirk than her saying that Jesus is her Lord!' This means that the Christian women are idolaters.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:253
</strong>Some apostles (messengers) are above others; to some of them Allah spoke (i.e., Allah has graded His messengers, He had spoken directly to a few of them); to Jesus, Allah gave clear signs and the Holy Spirit.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> Allah says in 4:152 He makes no distinctions among prophets.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:254
</strong>Unbelievers (non‑Muslims) are the real wrong‑doers; they will have no intercession on the last day.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 2:255 says Allah might appoint intercessor for anyone He wishes, including some unbelievers.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:255
</strong>Allah sustains and protects all that exists. His throne extends over the heavens; no one can intercede without His permission.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> see 2:254.


<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2:259
</strong>Allah caused a man to sleep for a century, then raised him up, and questioned the man how long he thought had been in sleep (in this verse Allah is directly speaking with an ordinary person).
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 42:51 says Allah speaks only through a veil or through a messenger.
