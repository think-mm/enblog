Italy would annually invest an amount of 200 million US dollars for coming 25 years for infrastructural   development of Libya that lost a lot during colonial rule. On August 30, 2008, Saturday, the Italian Premier, Silvio Barlusconi signed in Bengazi a pact of friendship and cooperation with the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi. Seeking apology on behalf of his countrymen, the Italian Premier said, "It is my duty as ahead of government to express to you in the name of the Italian people our regret and apology for the deep wounds that we have caused you." The Italian colonialism ruled over Libya for forty years, and exploited her. The Italian Premier said, "This pact of friendship and cooperation would alleviate the colonial wounds of forty years." He said, "It is concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on Libya by Italy during the colonial era."  (<a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/shahidul_islam/BritishColonialism_Shahidul.pdf">Read more...</a></span><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/shahidul_islam/BritishColonialism_Shahidul.jpg"><img src="https://muktomona.com/images/button/pdf.gif" alt="" /></a><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">)</span></p>
