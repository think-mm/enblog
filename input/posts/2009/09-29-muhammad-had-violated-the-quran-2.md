<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: Garamond;"><span style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Muhammad violated Allah's restriction on him on the number of his wives</span></span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span style="font-size: medium;">When Muhammad married Zaynab bte. Jahsh, the wife of his adopted son, Zayd b. Harith, Allah was a little bit displeased with Muhammad's audacious crave for young, beautiful, sexy women—married or single. So, Allah clamped down on Muhammad, sternly warning him that that was enough, that he could not accumulate further, any extra wives. Allah made Zaynab Muhammad's wife number eight or nine—the last wife. Here is the verse where Allah forbade Muhammad to marry further after marrying Zaynab bint Jahsh: </span><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Allah put restriction on Muhammad's marriage; he is not to take any new wife, neither exchange old wives for new… 33:52</span></em></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">033.052
YUSUFALI: It is not lawful for thee (to marry more) women after this, nor to change them for (other) wives, even though their beauty attract thee, except any thy right hand should possess (as handmaidens): and Allah doth watch over all things.</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Let us have a look at the list of women with whom Muhammad had some kind of connection, including sexual. This list has been prepared from the book of Tabari (vol. ix, pp.120-141). Please note that this list is in chronological order. Highlighted in the list is the name of Zaynab bint Jahsh to demonstrate how flagrantly Muhammad had dishonoured Allah's restriction on him—he had collected at least 13 more wives, a sex-slave and a concubine even when Allah commanded him to restrain his wife collection.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Muhammad had 21 wives. They were:</span></p>

</ol>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">People used to say that Muhammad was a womaniser</span></strong><span style="font-size: medium;"> (Tabari, IX:139).</span></span></p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;">
	<li>

</ol>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Even the one of the most eminent commentators and translators of the Qur'an, Maulana Yusuf Ali admits that Muhammad had indeed transgressed the stipulation of the Qur'an.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Yusuf Ali (commentary number 3754, p. 1123) writes: "This was revealed in A.H. 7. After that the Prophet did not marry again, except the handmaiden Mary the Copt, who was sent as a present by the Christians Muaqauqas of Egypt. She became the mother of Ibrahim, who died in his infancy."</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: Garamond;"><span style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Muhammad violated the Quranic law on the punishment for sex offenders</span></span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Fornication and adultery are two most serious offences in Islamic societies. These acts are worse than murder and plunder. The punitive measures, as enacted in the Qur'an, are truly extremely harsh and barbaric. Let us read the verse which deals with such grave crimes: </span><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Punishment for adultery or fornication (both man and woman) is one hundred lashes in front of the believers …24:2</span></em></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">024.022
YUSUFALI: The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Strangely, when it came to a friend of Muhammad, who admitted having committed a punishable offence (illegal sex, perhaps), Muhammad did not apply this Qur'anic rule. Here is a hadis from Sahih Bukhari on this violation of the Qur'an: <em>Muhammad did not punish a person for illegal sexual intercourse because the person prayed with him... </em>(Sahih Bukhari, 8.82.812)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Sahih Bukhari Volume 8, Book 82, Number 812
Narrated Anas bin Malik: While I was with the Prophet a man came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have committed a legally punishable sin; please inflict the legal punishment on me'.' The Prophet did not ask him what he had done. Then the time for the prayer became due and the man offered prayer along with the Prophet, and when the Prophet had finished his prayer, the man again got up and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have committed a legally punishable sin; please inflict the punishment on me according to Allah's Laws." The Prophet said, "Haven't you prayed with us?' He said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "Allah has forgiven your sin." or said, "....your legally punishable sin."</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: Garamond;"><span style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Muhammad violated the Quranic code of conduct between marriageable couples</span></span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Please note that a man and a woman who are not close relatives (that is, those men and women who could be married to each other, those who are not in the prohibited class for marriage purposes) cannot, under any circumstances, be alone together. This moral guardianship is endorsed in these verses of the Qur'an: <em>Believing men are to lower their gaze and guard modesty… </em>24:30</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">024.030
YUSUFALI: Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for greater purity for them: And Allah is well acquainted with all that they do.</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Let us observe what Muhammad did with some single women, who could be married to him.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">The first such woman was none but his first cousin-sister, Umm Hani bint Abu Talib. Muhammad passionately fell in love with her, but for some unknown reason his beloved uncle, Abu Talib did not give her hand to Muhammad when Muhammad requested. Instead, Abu Talib married her to a pagan, Hibayrah. But Muhammad's adulterous relation with Umm Hani (real name Fakitah, also known as Hind) continued. He used to sleep in her house, when no one was around. Such an incidence took place when Muhammad returned from his failed mission at Taif, after the deaths of his first wife, Khadijah and his uncle Abu Talib. Returning from Taif, he took shelter in Ka'ba. But at nightfall, when everyone was asleep, he stealthily went to Umm Hani's house and spent the night with her. In the morning, when the people did not find him at Ka'ba, they went looking for him. They found him in the house of Umm Hani. He was embarrassed. So was Umm Hani. To hide the truth, he concocted the story of his night journey to Jerusalem and Paradise from Umm Hani's house (more precisely, from her bed), which many converts of Islam found too incredible to believe. They left Islam then and there. This made Muhammad sad and withdrawn. Soon, after such an adulterous affair was leaked, he left Mecca and settled in Medina. But his undying love for Umm Hani remained aflame.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Later, when Muhammad became militarily strong and conquered Mecca, he went to Umm Hani's house and stayed with her overnight, praying and chit-chatting with her. Hubayrah, Umm Hani's husband had foreseen the fall of Mecca and had fled to Najran. So, Umm Hani was living in her house, separated from her pagan husband, and Muhammad was there comforting her, in open transgression of the Qur'anic code. (Please consult: Martin Lings, p.33, 101, 103-104, 299; Ibn Ishaq, p.184, Tabari, vol.viii, p.186)</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Here is a hadis from Sahih Bukhari which demonstrates Muhammad's way with single women, divorced or widowed, rich or poor, for sex, which clearly violates the Qur'an.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">A dignified woman, Jauniyaa (a princess) was brought to Muhammad to have sex with him but she was reluctant to give herself to him; Muhammad was angry and raised his hand to beat her... (Sahih Bukhari, 7.63.182)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 63, Number 182
Narrated Abu Usaid:
We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between which we sat down. The Prophet said, "Sit here," and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu'man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to her, "Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift." She said, "Can a princess give herself in marriage to an ordinary man?" The Prophet raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil. She said, "I seek refuge with Allah from you." He said, "You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge. Then the Prophet came out to us and said, "O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen dresses to wear and let her go back to her family." Narrated Sahl and Abu Usaid: The Prophet married Umaima bint Sharahil, and when she was brought to him, he stretched his hand towards her. It seemed that she disliked that, whereupon the Prophet ordered Abu Usaid to prepare her and to provide her with two white linen dresses. (See Hadith No. 541). </span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Readers should note that the woman mentioned in the above hadis was a minor, because her 'wet nurse' was with her when Muhammad wanted to have free sex with her. Also note that this child‑girl was perhaps naked when she met Muhammad, because Muhammad instructed Abu Usaid to cover her with white linen.</span></p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-size: large; font-family: Garamond;"><span style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Muhammad violated the Qur'anic rule on sex and fondling with menstruating women</span></span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">On menstruating women, the Qur'an says: <em>Menstruation is a disease; can't have sex during a woman's period; after the period is over have sex in any manner, at any time and at any place...</em> 2:222</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">022.222
YUSUFALI: They ask thee concerning women's courses. Say: They are a hurt and a pollution: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean. But when they have purified themselves, ye may approach them in any manner, time, or place ordained for you by Allah. For Allah loves those who turn to Him constantly and He loves those who keep themselves pure and clean.</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Please note that in verse 2:222 the Qur'an clearly says: So keep away from women in their courses, and do not approach them until they are clean.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Let us examine what Muhammad did to his wives when they were in heavy menstruation: <em>During Aisha's period Muhammad used to fondle her in bath. When menstruating Aisha used to wash Muhammad's head…(</em>Sahih Bukhari 1.6.298).</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 6 Number 298
Narrated 'Aisha:
The Prophet and I used to take a bath from a single pot while we were Junub. During the menses, he used to order me to put on an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me. While in Itikaf, he used to bring his head near me and I would wash it while I used to be in my periods (menses).</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Muhammad used to fondle his wives when they were menstruating…(</span></em><span style="font-size: medium;">Sahih Bukhari 1.6.299)</span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 6, Number 299
Narrated 'Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad:
(on the authority of his father) 'Aisha said: "Whenever Allah's Apostle wanted to fondle anyone of us during her periods (menses), he used to order her to put on an Izar and start fondling her." 'Aisha added, "None of you could control his sexual desires as the Prophet could."</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><em><span style="font-size: medium;">Muhammad used to embrace his menstruating wives after covering their private parts…</span></em><span style="font-size: medium;"> (Sahih Muslim 3.0578)</span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Sahih Muslim Book 003, Number 0578
'A'isha reported: When anyone amongst us was menstruating the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked her to tie waist-wrapper during the time when the menstrual blood profusely flowed and then embraced her; and she ('A'isha) observed: And who amongst you can have control over his desires as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had over his desires.</span></blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Muhammad put his cheek and chest in between the naked thighs of a menstruating Aisha...(Sunaan Abu Dawud, 1.0270)</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Sunaan Abu Dawud Volume i, Number 0270
Narrated Aisha, Ummul Mu'minin:
Umarah ibn Ghurab said that his paternal aunt narrated to him that she asked Aisha: What if one of us menstruates and she and her husband have no bed except one? She replied: I relate to you what the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) had done.</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">One night he entered (upon me) while I was menstruating. He went to the place of his prayer, that is, to the place of prayer reserved (for this purpose) in his house. He did not return until I felt asleep heavily, and he felt pain from cold. And he said: Come near me. I said: I am menstruating. He said: Uncover your thighs. I, therefore, uncovered both of my thighs. Then he put his cheek and chest on my thighs and I lent upon he until he became warm and slept. </span></p>
