Monmouth University of New Jersey hosted Global Understanding Convention at its campus on April 6<sup>th</sup> to understand the roots of all previous genocides. Dr. Nuran Nabi, a freedom Fighter of Bangladesh liberation war and currently a councilman of Plainsboro Township of New Jersey, was invited to speak on Bangladesh genocide during 1971. Dr. Skenderi of Pristhina University of Kosovo spoke on the genocide<span> </span>in former Yugoslavia during<span> </span>the 1990s.<span> </span>Dr. Adekunie spoke on the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and the ongoing genocide in Darfur.
<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Pearson, the Vice President and Provost of the Monmouth University opened the convention and Dean Dr. Green chaired the opening session. Professor Dr. Golam Mathbar, Dr. Dooley, Dr. Denney examined the degree to which religion, language and ethnicity have mattered in contemporary genocides. Scholars from national and international institutions as well as students of Monmouth University attended the convention.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Nabi presented a detailed description of the magnitude of Bangladesh Genocide and war crimes. He specially emphasized the point that Bangladesh war criminals were not put under trial for their war crimes. Though current Bangladesh government has taken initiative to put local war criminals under trial, however, war criminals who are in Pakistan and other countries are still beyond the reach of Bangladesh authority. Therefore, Dr. Nabi urged the international community to join in the campaign to bring those war criminals underal trial for their crimes against humanity. Dr. Nabi mentioned that Bangladesh genocide is a forgotten, least researched and least documented genocide. He proposed to start a course on Bangladesh genocide in Monmouth University. University authority responded to the proposal with a sympathetic consideration.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is to be mentioned that Dr. Nabi earlier presented Bangladesh genocide in a seminar in Rutgers University in last November and in Kean University in 2007.</p>
