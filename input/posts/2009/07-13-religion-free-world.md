<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="center"> </p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="center"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
 </span>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="center"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace </span>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="center"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one </span>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="center"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world </span>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="center"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one </span>

</span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">A religion free word is practically possible to build or it is just simply a hypothetical word will remain unsolved as long as the existence of human being remains. Religion came in this world on some back ground. The back ground some time was dangerous back ground of undisciplined way of maintaining lives. Some founders of religions had accepted many means to make the uncivilized people civilized on the name of some supreme authority God. They understood on that critical juncture of time if they would not mention the <span id="lw_1247485603_0" class="yshortcuts">name of God</span> then the people might not believe him or them. So people would not follow what they pronounced. They accepted many means and method to spread their religions. Many things they pronounced to control people and allow the people to divert from their path in course of changing time. Those religions have become the most successful spreading religions. </span></p>

<span style="font-size: 16pt;">
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Some religion founders were very soft and did not doctrine in a binding way that if the people would not follow his path then they will go to hell. Those religions were of soft in nature and now-a-days are limited to few people compared to other dominating religions at present time. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of the Japanese do not bother for religions. He who is very least bothered tells – Neither do I want to harm any one by my act or behavior nor I expect some one will harm me in any way by his/her behavior. I am supposed to help growing my nation and my country by helping myself to grow and develop. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">We the inhabitants of the world are aware of the growth and development of <span id="lw_1247485603_1" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Japan</span> . They are not worried to build nuclear bomb nor. Are Japanese not happy? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Side by side what our ancient people did who came to our subcontinent from central Asia ? Demolishing of idols in temples of other faith on the ground that idol worshiping was not prescribed in their Faith. So breaking of idols is nothing but showing respect to their faith. It was not their fault because they did not know the philosophical aspect of idols and also they did not know the story or mythology involving to each idol. The idols of ancient Arab and the idols of oriental culture were not the same. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">The people of Arab had not any idea or they were not known of the mythology about the idols of the east. There is mentioning of Jews and Christian in the scriptures composed in <span id="lw_1247485603_2" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Middle East</span> but nothing specifically was mentioned in those scriptures about   Hindu.   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">If there would be no religion probably the planet would be a better place to live more happily now-a-days. There would be no demolition of the worship places, burning the pilgrims in a running train, burning churches, demolition of mosques, demotion of temples, killing of peoples of other faiths on the name of religions. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">If there were no religions then <span id="lw_1247485603_3" class="yshortcuts">man and woman</span> could marry out side the boundary of their faiths. Perhaps no one could utter- Hey do not marry her/him because they are not from our faith. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">But what was the other side of religion-less society in the ancient time? Religion bounded the law less unethical people together and prevented them from many evils. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">We have come out from those ancient days but we are sticking to those ancient- time- pronounced- doctrines and are fighting with each other. Christian and Muslims are fighting, Jews and Muslims are fighting, <span id="lw_1247485603_4" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Hindus</span> and Muslims are fighting. Both are divided by religions. Both demanding separate places to dwell. What for? What is the root cause of this desire to live in separate land? Is a Muslim possesses different chemical composition of hemoglobin than that from a Christian or Hindu? </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Is a Hindu need different medicine to cure <span id="lw_1247485603_5" class="yshortcuts">malaria</span> than that from a Muslim?  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">          </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">Does religion is needed now? It may not be needed to those who are strong enough in mind to live without a God, who is not greedy to dominate other and who understand what is evil and what is not evil. But these kinds of people are a few and not respected by any of the so called faiths. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: medium;">If I do not go to temples and do not worship God then shall the God imaged as idols will curse me? Is he or she is so mean minded that he or she will harm me or destroy me? I do not think a true God is so merciless. Like wise I opine a true God of other faiths shall not be so merciless too if their followers do not go to their worshipping palaces. Worshipping or praying in a house of worship is completely a psychological way to calm down the emotion electrically generated in our nerves system and sensed by the sensors in our brains. It has nothing to do with religions. But the founders of our Faiths were so greedy to be the 'leaders' or to become famous that they mixed up all this with the religions as our present day greedy politicians mixed up religions with politics. There are many similarities between the present day politicians and the religion makers. In fact our present day clever politicians have acquainted this virtue from our religions founders. </span></p>
