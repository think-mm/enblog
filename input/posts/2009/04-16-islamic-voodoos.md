<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This small e-book probes into the traditions, customs, practices, and rites of Islam, which are largely based on Arab Bedouins' society of Muhammad's time. In a modern world, these Islamic customs and traditions are no more than superstitious beliefs and irrational acts—better known as voodoo practices. These Islamic Voodoos encompass practically every aspect of a Muslim's life—from birth to death. There are Islamic voodoos for angels, animals, biology, sorcery, resurrection, soul, Satan, hygiene, women, medicine, toilet practices and so on. Sourcing from the founts of Islam, such as the Qur'an and ahadith, we learn that much of what the Muslims believe to be divine, pure, salubrious, and supernatural actually have no scientific or rational basis. Muslims are pathetically duped by the claims that these Islamic Voodoos are meant to improve and uplift their lives, materially as well as spiritually. This is plain Islamic deception. The sooner the Muslims get rid of these illogical and senseless Islamic traditions and customs, the sooner they will be free from the bondage of Islamic Voodoos. </span></p>
