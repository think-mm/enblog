<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;" align="center"><a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/shabbir/index.html"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;">Shabbir Ahmed</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the aftermath of the tragic incidence in Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) Headquarter, a group of people are raising questions to confuse the gullible portion of the population of Bangladesh. In the process of asking questions, they are actually pointing fingers toward a neighboring country and the present government that they dislike. In fact, we should point fingers toward those who were the beneficiaries of similar incidences that took place in the past. This is necessary to maintain awareness among people so that the evil forces cannot encourage the killers to kill anymore for achieving their nasty political goals. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;">At this time, we all should be united against the culprits without finger-pointing at each other. However, national unity is a utopia in the context of Bangladesh at the present. We can only hope that with time people will know more about the conspirators that are working behind the scene to encourage more chaos and violence for their vicious political interest. These conspirators look forward to getting to power at the cost of the lives of many soldiers and officers. It appears that they are not willing to give up their old habits. After all, old habits die hard. To have awareness and make people alert against the mischievous activities of the supporters and agents of the behind-the-scene conspirators, I have summarized a few questions on the tragic incidence at the BDR Headquarter. These are as follows:</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(1)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It was noticeable that none of the central leaders of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-I-Islami (JI) were seen near the spot. Why did not BNP-JI MPs/leaders show their concerns and go to visit near the spot on the day of the incidence? Gen. (retd.) Ershad, Mr. Rashed Khan Menon, and many government party leaders went near the spot. What were the BNP-JI leaders doing in those two days?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(2)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Some reporters were trying to contact Mrs. Khaleda Zia on the first day of the crisis to get her reactions/concerns. She was not available for the whole day. She was not in her house. Where was she on that day of national crisis? </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(3)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Many political leaders were seen in TV expressing their reactions within a few hours of the occurrence of the incidence. Why did it take two days for Mrs. Zia to show up and express her concerns? Was she waiting and watching to see if it turns out to be a Sepai-Janata type biplob (revolution)?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(4)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Similar tragic incidences took place in the past. Who were the beneficiaries of those killings? Which quarter glorified the killings of many army officers that took place in the first week of November 1975? Have the beneficiaries of the past killings tried to repeat the same?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(5)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It has been reported that a number of groups of people belonging to BNP-JI organized processions chanting slogans â€œBDR-Janata Bhai Bhaiâ€ while many army officers and their family members were in danger inside the BDR Headquarter. Why did they try to encourage the killers like a few people that did the same in 1975?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(6)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">A Pakistani envoy came just a few days ago to Bangladesh. He commented against trying the war criminals while all the people of Bangladesh (except a few Razakars and their sympathizers) are eager to see the war criminals get proper punishment. The present army chief supported the trial of the war criminals a number of times. Is there any motive of Pakistan to save the war criminals by destabilizing the armed forces?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(7)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It is now revealed by one survivor (Lieutenant Colonel Shams) that he saw a civilian pick-up van loaded with arms. During BNP-JI rule, a ship load of arms were smuggled into Bangladesh. It was reported that BNP-JI high-ups were involved in the smuggling of the arms. Can we assume that the same groups of people are providing arms to the criminals to destabilize the government? Who planned for grenade attack on 21<sup>st</sup> August to kill the entire leadership of Awami league? Was not the planner a BNP leader and a minister under Khaleda-Nizami government?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(8)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">After every bomb attack in last 8/10 years, a group of people came out and tried to portray it as an act of India and/or Awami League. Eventually, it was revealed that the evil acts were done by BNP-JI leaders/members and their militant fundamentalist partners. Should not RAB/Police investigate and bring charges against these people for their efforts to cover-up and ultimately save the criminals?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(9)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">   </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The notoriety of ISI in destabilizing the governments by terrorism in many Southeast Asian countries was portrayed in both eastern and western media. In 1971, Pakistan army killed/tortured many members of Bengali army officers/soldiers and intellectuals with the help of Razakars/collaborators. Have they tried to take revenge again for electing the alliance under the leadership of Awami League? Is there any connection between ISI and the killings in BDR Headquarter.</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(10)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">                       </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In the past, BNP gave indemnity to killers and gave rewards for killing Bangabandhu, four national leaders, and many others including army officers. Did not a group of people conspire to kill and later they were rewarded by BNP? Have not they tried recently to give reward to a killer named Abdus Salam Pintu by nominating him for the last election? Are they trying to destabilize the country by giving the hints of rewards to the killers?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(11)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">                       </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Mrs.Zia, her associates, and her supporters are criticizing the government for not attacking the rebels in BDR Headquarter. This would have sparked reaction based on many rumors spread by the propagandists in all other locations in the country. The army and BDR could have been engaged in a fight throughout the country. The whole situation could have gone beyond the control of the government. At one point, the political government would have been marginalized. Who would have loved to see that happened? Who would have been the beneficiaries? Would not have the same group of people called the present government inefficient and brutal for allowing the fight beyond imagination between BDR and army? Are not these critics a group of sly and mischievous individuals trying to give lives to the politically dead BNP-JI?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(12)</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; font-style: normal; font-family: Verdana; font-variant: normal;">                       </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Many survivors and the BDR soldiers who did not take part in the rebellion told the reporters that the rebels were generally very young and were recruited two/three years ago. It was widely reported that during BNP-JI rule young Madrasa students and members/cadres of these parties were recruited under their influence.. Especially JI cadres are brain-washed Islamic fundamentalists. Would it be reasonable to assume that these cadres were mainly involved in the criminal and terrorist acts to destabilize the present government that defeated their parties in the last election?</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana;">The aforementioned questions I have presented here to try to prevent the propagandists in their efforts to cover up and conceal the brutal acts of the criminals. If we do not protest and expose the hidden agenda of the propagandists, they will continue covering up and will encourage more conspiracies and killings. We must remain alert and expose the web and waves of conspiracies the conspirators spread even in the sensitive areas where the armed forces work and live. The chaos in the sensitive areas can have fatal and tragic consequences as the one we painfully observed last week. As expected, the consequences would not remain limited in the specific place and time. It could cause a series of multiple effects throughout the country. For all these, the propagandists and the conspirators must be resisted. All in all, to prevent further conspiracies and killings, the tragic incidence that took place in BDR Headquarter must be investigated and the masterminds (whoever they may be) must be given the highest exemplary punishment.   </span></p>
