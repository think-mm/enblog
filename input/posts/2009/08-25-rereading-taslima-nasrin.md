<div><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Hi all,</span></div>
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Shraban Prokashoni has just brought out <strong>(Re)Reading <span id="lw_1251210328_0" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Taslima Nasrin</span></strong>. Edited by <a href="https://muktomona.com/Articles/ali_riaz/index.htm">Ali Riaz</a>, the book is a collection of recent essays on the content and context of Taslima Nasrin's work.

My essay, <strong>Woman Alone</strong>, on feminism, Taslima Nasrin and my development as a writer and as a woman is also in there. The article was <a href="https://muktomona.com/Articles/nadiya/woman_alone.htm">previously published in Mukto-Mona</a>.

Here is the cover picture of the book.
