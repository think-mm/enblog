<font face="Verdana">The 2009 is a very special year for us. This year Darwin's 200th Birthday will occur on February 12 and it will also be the 150th Anniversary of the publication of his famous book, <em>On The Origin of Species</em>. </font>

<font face="Verdana">Darwin Day, as we know, is now a global celebration of science and reason held on  February 12 each year, on the birthday anniversary of evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin. The Humanist Community in Palo Alto, Calif., began a Darwin Day celebration in 1995 and has had an annual event since that time. Renowned skeptic and biologist  Professor Massimo Pigliucci established a Darwin Day program at the University of Tennessee in 1996 that has continued to expand each year. The official website commemorating this event is <a href="https://www.darwinday.org/"><font color="#0000cc" face="Arial">www.darwinday.org</font></a>  and those interested may register individually to express their solidarity with the organizers of the event. Mukto-Mona has been celebrating Darwin day for last couple of years. <a href="https://muktomona.com/Special_Event_/Darwin_day/index.htm"><font color="#0000cc" face="Arial">Our first effort in 2006</font></a> created a massive sensation in the Net and beyond. The President  and vice-president of Darwin Day Celebrations organization thanked us for launching the <a href="https://muktomona.com/Special_Event_/Darwin_day/index.htm"><font color="#0000cc" face="Arial">special Darwin Day page</font></a>. Many Bangla newspapers including Daily Shamokal, Daily Sangbad, Science World featured our site on that eventful day, many news-media including German Bangla Radio took our interview. Darwin day, a virtually unknown event especially to Bengali community came into the focus of public attention immediately. We celebrated Darwin Day <a href="https://muktomona.com/Special_Event_/Darwin_day/2007/"><font color="#0000cc" face="Arial">last year</font></a> too. In this significant year we have a plan for even bigger celebration than ever! </font>

<font face="Verdana">Mukto Mona would like to announce its ongoing support for the International Darwin Day celebrations on Feb 12th once again, in keeping with our aim of promoting Science and Humanity. Darwin and his first publication of the book The Origin of Species contributed to a change in human thoughts not just in the field of science, but also in the humanities. It contributed to ending forever certain creationist religious myths that had been a staple of human thought in many centuries that preceded it. And, it contributed to understanding human evolution and the process of life in a way that none had before it.  </font>

<font face="Verdana">All over the world, more and more Humanist, Rationalist and Free thought groups as well as scientific communities are putting on events to celebrate 12 February, Darwin's birthday as 'Darwin Day'. This celebration of science and humanity, in honor of the scientist who perhaps more than any other has altered our understanding of the world and of ourselves, whose powerful explanation of the evolution of species made mythical deities redundant and design argument obsolete, is of  particular significance to all of us. The idea of Darwin Day as a secular celebration has been promoted by the Darwin Day Program, a non-profit organization dedicated to educational and social outreach activities aimed at widening understanding of topics related to evolution, and countering the impact of misinformation. Many ceremonies in our society are religious. But non-religious freethinkers like us celebrate various events too, and they prefer to do so in secular ceremonies that reflect their beliefs and values. Let Darwin Day be the part of our secular culture from now on. </font>

<font face="Verdana">To commemorate this event on this very special year, we would like to request our members to send their articles for our special Darwin Day page which would be launched on this day. Please send in your articles (either in Bangla or in English) at <a href="mailto:mukto-mona@yahoogroups.com"><font color="#0000cc" face="Arial">mukto-mona@yahoogroups.com</font></a>  and give a CC at <a href="mailto:mukto-mona-owner@yahoogroups.com"><font color="#0000cc" face="Arial">mukto-mona-owner@yahoogroups.com</font></a> before Feb the 10th so that we have time to design the page in time for the celebration. Darwin Day is now becoming a major international celebration of science and humanity. Darwin Day should be viewed as an important positive opportunity to bring secular and humanist groups together in a way that improves their public visibility and strengthens their voice in the arena of ideas so they can better serve as an inspiration for the future. Celebrate with us, and let us plan for a GRAND celebration on the 12th February with you. </font>

<font face="Verdana">With thanks and best wishes, </font>
