<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">For people like me who grew up and attended college in the 1960s, a mere mention of Secretary McNamara's name would bring back memory from those turbulent Vietnam days.  In the post Kennedy days under the baton of <span id="lw_1247063247_1" class="yshortcuts">President Lyndon B. Johnson</span> America 's mighty <span id="lw_1247063247_2" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">war machine</span> was bogged down in the lush paddy field of <span id="lw_1247063247_3" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Vietnam</span> where the GIS were fighting the Vietcong guerrillas all in the name of blocking communism, globally.  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">The U.S. Defense Secretary, Robert S. McNamara, with his characteristic rimless spectacles and back brush hairdo did dominate the headlines allover the world.  He was the chief architect of the expansion of war in Vietnam .  Powered by such false notion as "<span id="lw_1247063247_4" class="yshortcuts" style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Domino Theory</span>," America was more than determined to stop the cancerous growth of communism from Southeast Asia in the aftermath of <span id="lw_1247063247_5" class="yshortcuts">Korean War</span> in the early 1950s.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">On July 6, 2009 Robert S. McNamara who was affectionately called "Bob McNamara" by his friends in <span id="lw_1247063247_6" class="yshortcuts">Washington</span> died at the age of 93. McNamara remained reticent for about three decades after he resigned (or was fired) from the post of the Secretary of Defense when he served other duties but mainly as <span id="lw_1247063247_7" class="yshortcuts">president of the World Bank</span> for over a decade in the 1970s.  He however revealed his misgivings in an interview with an AP reporter in 1995 when he was promoting his best-selling memoir.  Privately, he doubted whether the war was winnable or worth fighting for.  McNamara told the AP interviewer, "We of the Kennedy and <span id="lw_1247063247_8" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Johnson administrations</span> acted according to what we thought were the principles and traditions of our country. But we were wrong. We were terribly wrong."</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">In late 1960s when the Vietnam War had escalated beyond anyone's imagination, many of his critics started to call it "McNamara's war."  Even his son opposed the war!  Undoubtedly, Secretary McNamara was the force behind the ill-fated Vietnam War who was an public optimist predicting that American military intervention in <span id="lw_1247063247_9" class="yshortcuts">South Vietnam</span> would give the leaders of that beleaguered nation to get their act together "by the end of 1965." </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Unfortunately, that prediction made by McNamara and other high-ranking U.S. officials from the State Department never came true.  The War dragged on up until 1975, with more than 58,000 U.S. soldiers being dead and 42,000 missing and severely injured.  When the GIs finally returned home in 1975, there was no welcoming celebration anywhere in America .  Some GIs begrudgingly had claimed that some irate citizens had spit on them. Indeed, America was a divided nation then.  </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Mr. McNamara wore different hats all throughout his public life.  He attended college both in <span id="lw_1247063247_10" class="yshortcuts">California</span> (UC Berkeley) and Massachusetts (<span id="lw_1247063247_11" class="yshortcuts">Harvard</span>) specializing in statistical analysis and business management.  Before being recruited by President Kennedy he served as the president of the <span id="lw_1247063247_12" class="yshortcuts">Ford Motor Company</span> in the mid fifties where he made unpopular decision to phase out Ford's Edsel line of cars and instead promoted smaller cars under the brand "Falcon."  This shrewd move made Ford Motor Company profitable again.  McNamara and his close associates at Ford were dubbed "the whiz kids."</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">The newly elected president, John F. Kennedy, recruited McNamara in 1961 from the <span id="lw_1247063247_13" class="yshortcuts">Ford Motor Company</span> to run the <span id="lw_1247063247_14" class="yshortcuts">Pentagon</span> even though he (McNamara) had no experience managing the military and was not considered an authority on military matters.  As the Defense Secretary he managed the Pentagon for seven long years, longer than anyone else since the job's creation in 1947. He left the position in 1968 on the verge of a nervous breakdown and became president of the World Bank.  McNamara once quipped to an AP reporter in late 1990s, nearly three decades after leaving the <span id="lw_1247063247_15" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Johnson Administration</span>, that he is not so sure whether he voluntarily resigned from the position or was he goaded to leave by <span id="lw_1247063247_16" class="yshortcuts">President Lyndon Johnson</span>.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Stung by the failure to win the war in Vietnam , McNamara finally had the epiphany that improving lives was a more promising path to peace than building up arms and armies.  Thus, he poured all the energies he had to the <span id="lw_1247063247_17" class="yshortcuts">World Bank</span> where he made <span id="lw_1247063247_18" class="yshortcuts">poverty alleviation</span> the central theme of that prestigious organization.  He served the Bank from 1968 through 1981 and then he retired at the age of 65.  In his <span id="lw_1247063247_19" class="yshortcuts">thirteen years</span> at the helm in the Bank, he introduced key changes, mostly focusing on targeted <span id="lw_1247063247_20" class="yshortcuts">poverty reduction</span>. He formulated policies to initiate a spectacular growth in funds to channel credits for development, in the form of health, food, and education projects.  To honor him, the World Bank currently has a scholarship program under his name.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">McNamara transformed himself to be an activist especially in the field of <span id="lw_1247063247_21" class="yshortcuts">nuclear weapon</span> when he vociferously opposed the proliferation of N-arms during the Reagan years.  He and several other former <span id="lw_1247063247_22" class="yshortcuts">national security officials</span> urged that the <span id="lw_1247063247_23" class="yshortcuts">United States pledge</span> not to use nuclear weapons first in Europe in the event of hostilities; subsequently he went further to propose the elimination of nuclear weapons as an element of NATO's defense posture. In his brilliant memoir, <em>In Retrospect</em>, published in 1995, he presented an account and analysis of the Vietnam War from his perspective. Reviews were however very mixed. This defense of his actions under Johnson Administration was viewed as McNamara's last attempt to apologize for his role in the war, but few critics have characterized it as merely shifting blame to other people and as an attempt to transform his image from an architect of the war into a virtual opponent.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">As an activist, McNamara took part in politics during recent years, delivering statements critical of the <span id="lw_1247063247_24" class="yshortcuts">Bush administration's March 2003 invasion of Iraq</span> .  On January 5, 2006, McNamara and most living former <span id="lw_1247063247_25" class="yshortcuts">Secretaries of Defense</span> and <span id="lw_1247063247_26" class="yshortcuts">Secretaries of State</span> met briefly at the <span id="lw_1247063247_27" class="yshortcuts">White House</span> with <span id="lw_1247063247_28" class="yshortcuts">President Bush</span> to discuss the war.  That short dialogue bore no fruit whatsoever.  President Bush went along with his military agenda to "democratize" <span id="lw_1247063247_29" class="yshortcuts">Iraq</span> with Shiite politicians at the helm.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"><span id="lw_1247063247_30" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Robert McNamara</span>, as a public official, made an enormous impact on the negative outcome of Vietnam War.  In his terminal years he said America had failed to see what would be the impact if the war was lost in Vietnam .  The entire Kennedy and <span id="lw_1247063247_31" class="yshortcuts">Johnson Administration</span> along with leading experts on East-West relationship had opined at the time that communism as an ideology should be stopped at all cost.  This was the essence of the "Domino Theory," which let the U.S. bogged down in the soggy ground of Vietnam while Mao's China trained and armed the Vietcong guerrillas to take on mighty America .  How thinks have changed dramatically in the span of a quarter century!  Now, America in the name of globalization is fueling the growth of capitalism in China .  Indeed, McNamara had lived long enough to see all these changes in his lifetime.   </span></span></p>
