<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">Barack Obama's oath taking ceremony took place later in the two-hour ceremony that has simply mesmerized this nation of over 300 million people.  This country has never quite experienced a ceremony like that despite the fact that <span id="lw_1232550987_7" class="yshortcuts">Mrs. Michelle Obama</span> did not wear an eye-catching gown.  Expectations were building over the last month for President Obama's <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1232550987_8" class="yshortcuts">swearing in ceremony</span>, which was attended by well over a million people in Washington D.C.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond"><span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1232550987_9" class="yshortcuts">President Bush</span> then boarded a helicopter to go to a hanger for some ceremony (to bid farewell to people who worked in close association with him, mostly Republicans).  Vice President Biden was near the helicopter to bid the outgoing president off.  The news report in the Internet stated that Bush will fly out to Texas near his ranch by a US Air Force plane sometime late in the <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1232550987_10" class="yshortcuts">inauguration day</span>, which is today, <span id="lw_1232550987_11" class="yshortcuts">January 20</span>, 2009.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">Now that both Bush and Cheney will no longer be in Washington D.C. after the inauguration of Obama and Biden, many critics worldwide would give grades to this Republican duo for taking a decent economy and making it a 70-year's low.  Never mind America 's involvement in a bloody war, which was undeclared.  Many opinion writers think that it was Bush's personal war.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">What was Bush's legacy after 8 years at the helm?  Bush's presidency was marred by the most unpopular war in the last 70 years.  There would be others who would be quick to say that it was a failed presidency.  Under his guidance, the US economy shrunk so much so that millions of people lost their job.  As of this writing <span id="lw_1232550987_12" class="yshortcuts">unemployment rate</span> is inching higher and there is no sign that it is abating anytime soon.  Americans are scared stiff knowing that there is no sign that tells them that the end is near and the economy is going turn the corner.  In the year 2001 when <span id="lw_1232550987_13" class="yshortcuts">President Clinton</span> left the office, the out-going president left a budget surplus.  However, the case is just the opposite.  The <span id="lw_1232550987_14" class="yshortcuts">Iraq War</span> was costing the US tax payers billions of dollars every month. To add insult to injury, the <span id="lw_1232550987_15" class="yshortcuts">tax revenue base</span> was shrinking for the last couple of years.  </font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">It will take however a good stewardship of economy on the part of Obama-Biden Administration to bring a semblance of normalcy in the U.S. economy.  Many critics blame Bush-Cheney duo for wrecking the U.S. economy, which also brought down the other economies of the world.  For one think, we now live in a globalized world and this downturn in global economy was expected in the aftermath of the decline in American economy by most pundits.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">President Bush was anything but an intellectual politician.  The same goes for the VP, <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1232550987_16" class="yshortcuts">Dick Cheney</span>.  When they took office in late <span id="lw_1232550987_17" class="yshortcuts">January 2001</span>, there was no vision for taking America to a higher ground by this administration.  Conversely, there were talks of starting war somewhere in the oil-rich <span id="lw_1232550987_18" class="yshortcuts">Arab nations</span>.  The terrible incidences of <span id="lw_1232550987_19" class="yshortcuts">September 11</span> in three places in the US simply served as the tinder.  It took almost 18 months for Bush to wage a war against <span id="lw_1232550987_20" class="yshortcuts">Iraq</span> .  When American GIs reached Baghdad in April 2003, <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1232550987_21" class="yshortcuts">Donald Rumsfeld</span>, Bush's first Defense Secretary, declared to the world press with much swagger that America was victorious over Saddam's army and the mission was accomplished.  Bush then visited the Navy ship SSS <em><span id="lw_1232550987_22" class="yshortcuts">Abraham Lincoln</span></em> on May 1, 2003 landing via a jet when the <span id="lw_1232550987_23" class="yshortcuts">navy ship</span> was approaching San Diego from <span id="lw_1232550987_24" class="yshortcuts">Pearl Harbor , Hawaii</span> .  It was a great publicity stunt but the phrase "<span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1232550987_25" class="yshortcuts">Mission Accomplished</span>" would haunt the president in years to come when it was becoming abundantly clear that Iraq War was not a successful war that he envisioned.  </font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">The captured foreign soldiers from <span id="lw_1232550987_26" class="yshortcuts">Afghanistan</span> were hauled all the way to a makeshift prison in <span id="lw_1232550987_27" class="yshortcuts">Guantánamo Bay</span> in the island of <span id="lw_1232550987_28" class="yshortcuts">Cuba</span> and tortured by the agents of US government including CIA.  This practice was severely critiqued by many in the US media and by <span id="lw_1232550987_29" class="yshortcuts">civil rights group</span>.  The detainees were tortured using such horrible method as "<span id="lw_1232550987_30" class="yshortcuts">waterboarding</span>", which is in violation of the UN guidelines on how to humanely deal with POW.  Only a handful of the detainees were prosecuted but many languished in the jail without facing any court.  The Guantánamo camp brought so much infamy for the US government that President Obama has decided long before taking the oath for the office that one of the earlier tasks for him would be to dismantle this despicable military camp, which has given American government a bad name.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">Under President Bush, the Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, sacked 7 federal attorneys in December 2006, because of ideological reason. George Bush thought these dismissed US Attorneys were investigating Republican governors and lawmakers for ideological reason.  Others thought that these firing of attorneys were "fundamentally flawed," and "raised doubts about the integrity of Department prosecution decisions." Under a mounting opposition, the <span id="lw_1232550987_31" class="yshortcuts">Attorney General</span>, Mr. Gonzales, had to resign in disgrace.  Perhaps, this is legacy that will go down in the annals of judiciary history of America.</font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font size="4" face="Garamond">American historians those specializing in US government will probably judge George Bush very negatively and unkindly. Before his tenure could expire, many a historian has said openly that George Bush would make a failing grade as a president.  It is very doubtful whether any future president would emulate his presidency as a model to follow.  The Iraq War, the collapse in the financial world due to excessive subprime lending, a deep recession caused by excesses in the home building sector, a blatant disregard for human rights of captured foreign soldiers, etc., will remain Bush's failure and emblematic of a failed presidency.  His was a legacy of failed <span id="lw_1232550987_32" class="yshortcuts">public policies</span>.  Bush never did consult a large body of intellectuals and experts in the field and this is perhaps is the reason why his public policies never blossomed but instead withered in the vine.</font></span></p>
