2009 Nobel Prize in Literature
By Adnan Lermontov
	
Salman Rushdie will not win the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature.  In fact, he will never win.  The Nobel Committee will not make this mistake.  He is too controversial.  Why chop off your own feet?  Perhaps not winning it is the greatest prize Rushdie could ever win.  Rushdie is my first choice, but since he will not win it (i hope i am wrong), I will have to move on with my predictions.

In recent years multiple scientists are receiving Nobel Prize from each category.  Why not do the same for literature as well?  At least three authors should win Nobel Prize in Literature each year from different parts of the world.  

I think Haruki Murakami will win the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature. Or, it could be Ngugi wa Thiongo.

My 4th, 5th and 6th choices are: Milan Kundera, Mario Vargas Llosa and Umberto Eco.

The chance for a poet to win this award is extremely high this year.  The last poet to win this award was Wislawa Szymborska back in 1996.  This is the longest time gap between two poets to win this award.  I hope that a poet wins it this year, since the Nobel Committee did not award a single poet in the new century yet.  That is a shame!
