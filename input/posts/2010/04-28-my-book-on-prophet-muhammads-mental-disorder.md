<span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">Dear valued readers</span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have written a book <strong>"Unmasking Muhammad; The Malignant Narcissist and his Grand Delusion Allah", </strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">which is available for free download.</span></strong><strong> </strong></span></span>

<span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">In this research work, I have shown with enough evidence that Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam was suffering from a mental disorder. The name of this mental disorder is <strong>"Malignant Narcissism"</strong> and because of his mental illness he thought himself to be a messenger of God. It was his Grand Delusion. </span>

<span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">He was also suffering from Hallucinations – both visual and auditory.</span>

<span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">In this literature, I have unfolded the mystery of Islam, Qur'an and Allah with step by step explanation. This book is already published in different websites and gaining popularity.</span>

<span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;">I could make money by publishing this book in print; but I don't want to do so. My intention is to reach maximum number of readers. So I give it for free download. The complete book is in PDF and of 295 pages and written in academic style. I have written this book after a hard research of nine months.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;">In this treatise I have no intention to test God. I just want to test Muhammad's claim to the title of messenger of God because I cannot blindly accept his claim. Throughout the recorded history of Mankind, many imposters had posed as God-man and fooled us. Muhammad may be a true prophet or he may be an imposter. We must test him to see which he is. Anyone who claims to be a prophet must be prepared to have his prophecy tested.</span></p>
