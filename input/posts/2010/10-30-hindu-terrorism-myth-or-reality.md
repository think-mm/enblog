They have successfully fooled few third rated thinkers with their half truths and some politicians at times like to promote Muslim's views of Hindu terrorism. Because of this, in India, recently a new term is coined – the 'Saffron terror', which is allegedly inspired by Hindu fundamentalism. Since Saffron terror is relatively a newer issue, the present author wants to discuss a bit about the origin and the significance of the Saffron and how much link does it have with terrorism.</span></p>

The sacred soil of this holy land was not only a land of spirituality, philosophy and self-realization but also a land of peace, culture, music, dance and literature for thousands of years till the time an army of 'half humanized half ape' Bedouin barbarians attacked this holy land with sword in one hand and a demonic book 'Qur'an' in other hand. This ancient nation is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. </span></p>

It is the color of 'Agni' or fire, which symbolizes the Supreme Being. Fire worship had its origin in the Vedic age. The saffron color, also auspicious to the Sikhs, the Buddhists and the Jains, seems to have obtained religious significance much before these religions came into being. During olden days, when sages moved from one ashram (a religious hermitage) to another, it was customary to carry the fire along. But it was inconvenient to carry a burning substance over long distances. This had given rise to the symbol of a saffron flag, a symbol for flames. Triangular and often forked saffron flags are seen fluttering atop most Sikh and Hindu temples. While Sikhs regard it as a militant color, Buddhist monks and Hindu saints wear robes of this color as a mark of renunciation of material life. Saffron is the symbol of united India.</span></p>

In support of their views, Muslims give examples of LTTEs (Tamil tigers who were Hindus) and Sikh terrorists used for Khalistanis. No doubt the Tamil tigers were mostly Hindus but they were not motivated by religion. What LTTE had been doing for decades was undoubtedly terrorism, but it does not qualify as something that can be called 'Hindu terrorism' because religion was not the driving force or ideology behind their insurgency. It's more of 'race', 'language' and 'politics' than religion. Secondly, LTTE movement was mainly a 'local' problem in northern part of Sri Lanka, not as widespread as Islamic terrorism which is a serious threat to the whole world. Islamic terrorists are absolutely motivated by religion and therefore it would be illogical to compare Muslim terrorists with LTTEs. Similarly Khalistani movement was also a 'local' issue. Moreover today both LTTE and Khalistani movement are in history, but Islamic terrorism is at its peak. </span></p>

In the case of Islam, religion has become most important issue. Nationality and race have practically no significance. Because of this, any perceived atrocity against Muslims in any corner of the world is being avenged by taking lives of completely unrelated innocent people somewhere else in the name of Allah. This 'global link' of religion is nonexistent not only amongst Hindus but practically to any other religion except Islam. There is Muslim 'Ummah', but there is no Hindu 'Ummah'. Hence; Hindu and Sikh terrorists do not exist on global chart but Muslim terrorists exist. Correlating Buddhists and Jains with terrorism is an absurd thought.</span></p>

Hinduism talks about "<em>Sarva dharma sambhava</em>" (equal respect for all religions) (Ralhan, 1999, p.1046). This ancient faith is also known as 'Sanatana Dharma' (Eternal religion) and the five principal virtues prescribed by all schools of Sanatana Dharma are non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity and non-covetousness (Saraf, 1996, p.60). Do the Muslims find all these virtues in the teaching of Muhammad? </span></p>

The term Saffron terror is a deliberate misinformation. Muslims use this term for obvious reasons and some Indian politicians use it for Muslim sycophancy.

If intolerance is really on the rise amongst Indian Hindus, it needs to be exposed and strong corrective action needs to be taken before it flourishes.

They breed and multiply very fast and ultimately eat away the very culture of their host nation and try to replace it with a seventh century barbaric mentality. They demand honor and dignity from the non-Muslims but give them hate, death and destruction in return. Once they achieve power, they start ethnic cleansing of the aboriginal. In every corner of the world, the Muslim mentality is same with hardly any exception.</span></p>

There is near-total ethnic cleansing of Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh; but if Hindus are really fanatic, why the world does not see same type of ethnic cleansing of the Muslims or other minorities in the Hindu majority India?

They believe that if Muslims cannot coexist peacefully with them in areas where Muslims are a majority, why should Hindus be forced to live peacefully with Muslims where Hindus are a majority? If Muslims are killing Hindus in Kashmir, then what wrong it is to kill the Muslims in Gujarat?</span></p>

An eye for an eye cannot be the norm of a civilized society. It also goes against the age-old teaching of Hinduism. If the vast majority of the Hindus are misguided by this logic, which is most unlikely to happen in the future, India will become a mirror image of Pakistan and Afghanistan. This is a fate the Indians should avoid at all costs because it means not only destroying the core values of Indian culture and civilization but our prosperity and success in global arena. Today India is making astronomical progress in the areas of economy and trade, science and technology, medicine, energy, education, space and ocean exploration, defense, culture, entertainment, sports and people-to-people contacts. Tomorrow India will have to take the responsibility to provide leadership to the world. </span></p>

History demonstrates that intolerance and fanaticism in one religion provokes intolerance and fanaticism in other religions. This is a defense mechanism and very much normal. Before the advent of Islam, Hinduism was an extremely liberal religion and the Hindus were hardly united in religious faith. There were several sects and sub-sects who were not at all perturbed by the differences of the religious values of others and lived in harmony with one another. A large part of India united under the banner of Hinduism only when Islam started bloodshed on Indian soil as if all the sects and sub-sects suddenly realized their oneness and religious singularity. The Sikh religion was formed from Hinduism to protect India from Islamic assault. This way, the Sikhs are inseparable from the Hindus. Every Sikh is a warrior Hindu duty-bound to protect India from Muslim aggression.</span></p>

The Western Christians are uniting to save their land, religious values and culture from Islamic aggression. There are many strong anti-Islam groups in Nepal, Israel, UK, USA, Germany and France and they often work in close connection with one another to save their countrymen. The Thai and Vietnamese Buddhists are protesting against Muslims for the same reason. This is patriotism. But when we see that a Florida-based Church announced plans to burn copies of the Qur'an on church grounds to mark the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, it is religious fanaticism. </span></p>

Surprisingly another very powerful and controversial Indian politician, an octogenarian, founder and chief of a Hindu nationalist organization who has his base at Mumbai (a commercial city in the western part of India) supported the young politician's derogatory views. This octogenarian is very vocal in his controversial opposition to people who migrate to Mumbai, especially Muslims. He has urged the Hindus to start calling India <em>'Hindu Rashtra'</em> (Hindu nation) by mentioning that only Hinduism to be honored in India. Not only this, in 2002 this powerful politician issued a call to form a Hindu suicide squad to counter alleged Muslim violence (Puniyani, 2006, p. 123). When he called for a Hindu suicide squad, two retired generals from Indian army actually started such a camp and commenced giving training to some aspiring suicide bombers (Soondas, 2002). However, police intervened in time and the camps were closed. </span></p>

Though Hinduism preaches nonviolence but given the size of India's Hindu population, it would be surprising if there were no loonies at all within the community. Hence, the right-minded Indian citizens should draw a strong boundary line between patriotism and fanaticism. For a true Indian, a pinch of soil of India is more precious than gold. Loving own motherland and sacrificing for her is a matter of honor, pride and dignity but fanaticism is a matter of shame. </span></p>
