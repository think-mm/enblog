<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">Conquering some insurmountable odds Obama beat Senator John McCain on November 4, 2008.<span>  </span>It was definitely a history making event in <st1></st1><st1></st1>America.<span>  </span>Barack Obama, a virtually unknown entity in American politics who came to <st1></st1><st1></st1>Washington in 2006 as a senator, had rapidly ascended to the highest position beating all the odds.<span>  </span>He would be sworn as the 44<sup>th</sup> president of <st1></st1><st1></st1>America on January 20, 2009.<o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">The Associated Press writer Ron Fournier wrote that Obama's transcendence is beyond race. Hardly a few years ago it was unthinkable to elect a man of color to White House.<span>  </span>Nonetheless, it happened.<span>  </span>This is definitely a once in a life-time event.<span>  </span><o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">About 20 months ago, Barack Obama went to small towns in <st1></st1><st1></st1>Iowa expressing an interest to run for the Democratic primaries.<span>  </span>He gave the Iowans a vision for tomorrow, they liked his idea, gave him small donations, and he started a campaign that culminated on November 4, 2008.<span>  </span>The path to White House was tortuous to say the least.<span>  </span>Nonetheless, his message went through and finally he became the nominee of the Democratic Party beating one of the most popular candidates of our time, Senator Hillary Clinton. <o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">As the day wore by, the campaign for White House became a nasty one.<span>  </span>The Republican candidate and his surrogates threw all the epithets on him and he braved those insults with a smiling face.<span>  </span>Then the news of economic meltdown in the Wall Street came in September 2008.<span>  </span>This cataclysmic event catapulted Obama to stratospheric height because he remained calm and listened to the expert.<span>  </span>He then went to <st1></st1><st1></st1>Washington meeting with the president and his colleague at the senate.<span>  </span>This contrasted with that of Senator McCain who behaved erratically.<o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">Barack Obama's message of change struck a chord with the American voters who saw how the nation suffered in the hands of Bush and Cheney.<span>  </span>The government's expense was rising, the budget deficit was escalating, and people's standard of living was heading down due to a rapid inflation in the prices of everyday commodities including that of energy cost.<span>  </span>The common ordinary people were facing economic hardship while the government of Bush-Cheney remained nonchalance. The popularity poll of George W. Bush plummeted all time low and it affected the campaign of John McCain who the voters thought to be a clone of the president who belonged to the same party.<span>  </span>In essence, the political philosophy of George W. Bush and John McCain was virtually the same.<o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">About 3 million ordinary people of <st1></st1><st1></st1>America have funded Barack Obama's political campaign.<span>  </span>After receiving the news of the victory, Obama wrote this e-mail to his donors and supporters.<span>  </span>It came to my mail box right before he gave the victory speech at Grant Park, <st1></st1><st1></st1>Chicago on November 4 and it reads as follows:<o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">"I'm about to head to Grant Park to talk to everyone gathered there, but I wanted to write to you first.
We just made history. And I don't want you to forget how we did it. You made history every single day during this campaign -- every day you knocked on doors, made a donation, or talked to your family, friends, and neighbors about why you believe it's time for change. I want to thank all of you who gave your time, talent, and passion to this campaign. We have a lot of work to do to get our country back on track, and I'll be in touch soon about what comes next. But I want to be very clear about one thing... All of this happened because of you. Thank you, Barack"<o></o></font></font></span></blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">At CNN's Election Night coverage there were quite a few Republican analysts.<span>  </span>One of them, William Bennett, said that Obama ran a very impressive and flawless campaign.<span>  </span>Most analysts have opined that they have never seen such a campaign that did not make any error.<span>  </span>Also, Obama used the Internet to the fullest extent.<span>  </span>The campaign never had any problem getting donations from supporters.<span>  </span>It was truly an Internet-based grassroots movement.<o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">Obama's message of change had touched the hearts and minds of Americans of all walks of life.<span>  </span>He was able to build a coalition of voters from minority folks, younger generation, white collar Americans, and the Democratic base composed of factory workers, unionists, labor, etc.<span>  </span>They have responded to his call for a change in <st1></st1><st1></st1>America.<span>  </span><o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">At the Victory speech given at Grant Park before 125,000 people, Obama promised to fulfill his election pledge.<span>  </span>He also said that he will need help and cooperation from ordinary Americans to build a better <st1></st1><st1></st1>America.<span>  </span>It was a historic speech which will go down in the annals of American politics as one of the finest victory speeches given at any time.<o></o></font></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">Barack Obama is considered a visionary and transformative politician.<span>  </span><st1></st1><st1></st1>America needs a leader like him when bad times have fallen all across the nation.<span>  </span>He promised to bring a change in the way the government is run.<span>  </span><st1></st1><st1></st1>America is surely entering a new age with an African American president.<span>  </span>Let us hope that it is a new beginning not only for <st1></st1><st1></st1>America but also for the world.<o></o></font></font></span></p>
