<strong>(CNN) </strong>– John McCain and his aides are still banking on a come-from-behind victory Tuesday, but the GOP's most famous political strategist is forecasting Obama is well positioned to win.

Karl Rove, the man widely credited with engineering President Bush's two successful White House bids, is out with <a href="https://www.rove.com/election"><strong>a new map showing </strong></a>the Illinois senator will take the White House in an Electoral College landslide, winning 338 votes to John McCain's 200. That would be the largest Electoral College victory since 1996, when Bill Clinton defeated Bob Dole in a 379-159 rout.

In an Electoral Map posted on Rove's Web site, the Republican mastermind shows Obama victories in several key battlegrounds, including virtually all of the states where polls suggest he currently enjoys a slim advantage. In fact, Rove believes Missouri is the only crucial battleground state McCain will carry, while Obama scores victories in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota, and Iowa. Rove also thinks Obama will win traditionally-Republican Virginia.
