**America finally got a new 'Rhythm of Life' on November 4**  
~ *[A.H. Jaffor Ullah](https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/jaffor/index.html)*

A chorus by the name "Rhythm of Life" was first published in 1966 and it composed by Cy Coleman, which became a Broadway hit right away. I recorded the song using a mixing board and a digital recorder this summer in New Orleans’ "The Pavilion of Two Sisters" located at the picturesque Botanical Garden.  The chorus was performed by "Symphony Chorus of New Orleans" under the baton of Mr. Steven Edwards. It is a very spirited and uplifting song. As you listen to it, you will realize this instantaneously. This song will give you a jolt. I thought Barack Obama’s victory also jolted many of us; therefore, I would like to share this song with you.  America and the rest of this world got a "New Rhythm of Life" on November 4, 2008. Please enjoy this chorus.

Here is the lyric of the shortened version:

> And The Rhythm Of Life is a powerful beat,
> Puts a tingle in your fingers and a tingle in your feet,
> Rhythm in your bedroom,
> Rhythm in the street,
> Yes, The Rhythm Of Life is a powerful beat,
> To feel The Rhythm Of Life,
> To feel the powerful beat,
> To feel the tingle in your fingers,
> To feel the tingle in your feet,
> To feel The Rhythm Of Life,
> To feel the powerful beat,
> To feel the tingle in your fingers,
> To feel the tingle in your feet,
> Flip your wings and fly to Daddy,
> Take a dive and swim to Daddy,
> Hit the floor and crawl to Daddy,
> Daddy we got The Rhythm Of Life,
> Of life, of life, of life.
> Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
> Man!
