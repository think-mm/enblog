Dr. Nuran Nabi, a former scientist and a noted secular Bangladeshi-American, has been reelected the councilman in the Plainsboro Township Council of NJ, USA. Voters in Plainsboro overwhelmingly elected Dr. Nuran Nabi with 70% vote to the Council. Last year Dr. Nabi was appointed by the Township Council to fill a vacant seat and he was seeking reelection on last Tuesdayâ€™s national election. It may be mentioned that President elect Obama has also received 70% vote in Pliansboro Township. 

Dr. Nabi has been a long time member and well-wisher of muktomona. We take delight in his victory.

Congratulations, Dr. Nabi!
