<strong>Nov. 4, 2008</strong>--There's been an e-mail going around advising black folks on unacceptable behavior if <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1225841561_1" class="yshortcuts">Barack Obama</span> wins. We at <em><strong>The Root </strong></em>thought we'd add a few tips of our own.
 
<blockquote>1. No Negro spirituals or quotes from Dr. King. <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1225841561_2" class="yshortcuts">John Hope Franklin</span> can get away with this. The rest of us cannot.

2. Don't go up to every "redneck-y" looking person and gloat. "It hurts don't it? It burrrrnnss!" <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=759SCBcUxto&amp;feature=related"><span id="lw_1225841561_3" class="yshortcuts">Dave Chappelle warned us</span></a> about parading our pride too much.

3. Don't corner your white coworkers to give them a tutorial on black culture just because "the president is black and it's 'bout time y'all learn!"

4. Don't go to your local DMV, post office or other government office and try to jump the line, talkin' 'bout, "Barack's got my back."

5. Do not promise to name your first child after Barack Obama. We've come far, but <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1225841561_4" class="yshortcuts">Barack Obama Jackson</span> does not have as much of a ring to it as you think.</blockquote>

<strong>Nov. 4, 2008</strong>--Black people aren't the only ones worried about <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.theroot.com/id/48696"><span id="lw_1225841561_5" class="yshortcuts">embarrassing themselves</span></a> if Obama wins. Here are a few pointers for white people.
<blockquote><strong>1. Don't personally congratulate all your black friends.</strong>

Black people are not a sports team, and Obama did not win the <span id="lw_1225841561_6" class="yshortcuts">Super Bowl</span>.

<strong>2. Don't declare that you "never thought you'd see the day."</strong>

<em>You</em> never thought you'd see the day?

<strong>3. Don't start crossing the street in order to walk next to a black person. </strong>

President Obama is glad you support racial reconciliation, but he takes a hard line against jaywalking.

<strong>4. Don't name drop "Dr. King."</strong>

If you absolutely must make some comment about how this is a victory for <span id="lw_1225841561_7" class="yshortcuts">civil rights</span>, pick a marginally less obvious figurehead.

<strong>5. Don't use the phrase "white people" in any way that suggests it doesn't include you.</strong></blockquote>
Contrary to popular belief, having voted for Obama does not make you even "<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.theroot.com/id/47196"><span id="lw_1225841561_8" class="yshortcuts">semi-down</span></a>." Sorry if there was any confusion there.
