**Speak your mind Bloggers!**

#### New Blog Feature has been added in our site

We are proud to announce a neat little blog feature has been added in the English section of our site: [Mukto-Mona writers' corner](https://en.muktomona.com). At this moment we just allow the members and visitors to comment on several articles. Mukto-Mona  will eventually provide a fully-featured blogging add-ons that will enable like-minded members to create their very own online blogs within our site (without any need of an editor or webmaster). Besides the ongoing activities in [mukto-mona yahoogroups](https://groups.google.com/g/muktomona), It will give our members a place to post thoughts and ideas and it  will keep users returning to the community again and again, and advanced administration features allow forum owners and moderators to keep control and integrate blog into Mukto-Mona's existing look and feel.

Indeed, there are many blogs in the Net focusing on a particular or specific topic, such as web design, home staging, sports, or mobile technology, politics or social issues. While some are more eclectic, presenting links to all types of other sites, others are more like personal journals, presenting the author's daily life and thoughts.  Then why starting another blog from mukto-mona? Because we dream  to bring progressive people together to promote progressive visions for humanistic and rational life through an interactive platform. Mukto-Mona being an Internet congregation of freethinkers, rationalists, skeptics, atheists & humanists across the globe, its blog's primary goal will be to promote science, rationalism, secularism, freethinking, human rights, religious tolerance, and harmony amongst all people. Our blog will thus continue to cultivate rational thoughts, ethical values, progressive politics, and human development through the advancement of latest science and technology. It will also engage in publishing view relating to the critical examination of religious and supernatural claims and the humanist outlook. Mukto-Mona Blog will be dedicated to defending and promoting a naturalistic worldview on the Internet as before.

Lastly, Readers are requested to keep their comments short.  Comments are naturally expected to be relevant to the topic of the specific article. 

Happy Blogging!
