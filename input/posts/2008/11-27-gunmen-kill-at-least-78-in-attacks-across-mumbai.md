<font face="Verdana">MUMBAI, India – Teams of heavily armed gunmen stormed luxury hotels, a popular restaurant and a crowded train station in coordinated attacks across India's financial capital Wednesday night, killing at least 78 people and taking Westerners hostage, police said. An explosion followed by a raging fire struck one of the hotels, the landmark Taj Mahal, early Thursday. Screams could be heard and enormous clouds of black smoke rose from the at the century-old edifice on Mumbai's waterfront. Firefighters were spraying water at the blaze.</font>

<font face="Verdana">The attackers specifically targeted Britons and Americans, witnesses said. Fires burned and gunfire was heard for hours. Officials said at least 200 people were wounded.</font>

<font face="Verdana">The motive for the onslaught was not immediately clear, but Mumbai has frequently been targeted in terrorist attacks blamed on <span id="lw_1227737925_0" class="yshortcuts">Islamic extremists</span>, including a series of bombings in July 2007 that killed 187 people.</font>

<font face="Verdana">An Indian media report said a previously unknown group calling itself the Deccan <span style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none" id="lw_1227737925_1" class="yshortcuts">Mujahideen</span> had claimed responsibility for the attacks in e-mails to several media outlets.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Police reported hostages being held at the Taj Mahal and <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227737925_2" class="yshortcuts">Oberoi hotels</span>, two of the best-known upscale destinations in this crowded but wealthy city.</font>

<font face="Verdana"><span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227737925_3" class="yshortcuts">Gunmen</span> who burst into the Taj "were targeting foreigners. They kept shouting: `Who has U.S. or U.K. passports?'" said <span id="lw_1227737925_4" class="yshortcuts">Ashok Patel</span>, a British citizen who fled from the hotel.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Authorities believed seven to 15 foreigners were prisoners at the Taj Mahal, but it was not immediately clear if hostages at the Oberoi were Indians or foreigners, said Anees Ahmed, a top state official.</font>

<font face="Verdana">State Department spokesman Robert Wood said U.S. officials were not aware of any American casualties, but were still checking. He said he could not address reports that Westerners might be among the hostages.</font>

<font face="Verdana">"We condemn these attacks and the loss of innocent life," White House spokesman <span id="lw_1227737925_5" class="yshortcuts">Tony Fratto</span> said.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Johnny Joseph, chief secretary for <span id="lw_1227737925_6" class="yshortcuts">Maharashtra</span> state, of which Mumbai is the capital, said 78 people had been killed and 200 had been wounded.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Blood smeared the floor of the Chhatrapati Shivaji rail station, where attackers sprayed bullets into the crowded terminal. <span id="lw_1227737925_7" class="yshortcuts">Press Trust of India</span> quoted the chief of the Mumbai railway police, A.K. Sharma, as saying several men armed with rifles and grenades were holed up at the station.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Other gunmen attacked Leopold's restaurant, a landmark popular with foreigners, and the <span id="lw_1227737925_8" class="yshortcuts">police headquarters</span> in southern <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227737925_9" class="yshortcuts">Mumbai</span>, the area where most of the attacks took place. The restaurant was riddled with bullet holes and there were blood on the floor and shoes left by fleeing customers.</font>

<font face="Verdana">A British citizen who was dining at the <span id="lw_1227737925_10" class="yshortcuts">Oberoi hotel</span> told <span style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none" id="lw_1227737925_11" class="yshortcuts">Sky News television</span> that the gunmen who struck there singled out Britons and Americans.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Alex Chamberlain said a gunman, a young man of 22 or 23, ushered 30 or 40 people from the restaurant into a stairway and ordered everyone to put up their hands. He said the gunman spoke in Hindi or Urdu.</font>

<font face="Verdana">"They were talking about British and Americans specifically. There was an Italian guy, who, you know, they said: 'Where are you from?" and he said he's from <span id="lw_1227737925_12" class="yshortcuts">Italy</span> and they said 'fine' and they left him alone. And I thought: 'Fine, they're going to shoot me if they ask me anything — and thank God they didn't," he said.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Chamberlain said he managed to slip away as the patrons were forced to walk up stairs, but he thought much of the group was being held hostage.</font>

<font face="Verdana">Early Thursday, several European lawmakers were among people who barricaded themselves inside the Taj, a century-old seaside hotel complex and one of the city's best-known destinations.</font>

<font face="Verdana">"I was in the main lobby and there was all of a sudden a lot of firing outside," said <span id="lw_1227737925_13" class="yshortcuts">Sajjad Karim</span>, part of a delegation of European lawmakers visiting Mumbai ahead of a <span id="lw_1227737925_14" class="yshortcuts">European Union</span>-<span id="lw_1227737925_15" class="yshortcuts">India</span> summit. </font>

<font face="Verdana">As he turned to get away, "all of a sudden another gunmen appeared in front of us, carrying machine gun-type weapons. And he just started firing at us ... I just turned and ran in the opposite direction," he told The Associated Press over his mobile phone. </font>

<font face="Verdana">Hours later, Karim remained holed up in a hotel restaurant, unsure if it was safe to come out. </font>

<font face="Verdana">The <span id="lw_1227737925_16" class="yshortcuts">British Foreign Office</span> said it was advising all British citizens in Mumbai to stay indoors. </font>

<font face="Verdana">Britain's foreign secretary, David Miliband, strongly condemned the attacks. "Today's attacks in Mumbai which have claimed many <span id="lw_1227737925_17" class="yshortcuts">innocent victims</span> remind us, yet again, of the threat we face from violent extremists," Miliband said in a statement. </font>

<font face="Verdana"><span id="lw_1227737925_18" class="yshortcuts">India</span> has been wracked by bomb attacks the past three years, which police blame on Muslim militants intent on destabilizing this largely Hindu country. Nearly 700 people have died. </font>

<font face="Verdana">Since May a <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227737925_19" class="yshortcuts">militant group</span> calling itself the <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227737925_20" class="yshortcuts">Indian Mujahideen</span> has taken credit for a string of blasts that killed more than 130 people. The most recent was in September, when a series of explosions struck a park and crowded shopping areas in the capital, <span id="lw_1227737925_21" class="yshortcuts">New Delhi</span>, killing 21 people and wounding about 100. </font>

<font face="Verdana">Mumbai has been hit repeatedly by terror attacks since March 1993, when Muslim underworld figures tied to Pakistani militants allegedly carried out a series of bombings on <span id="lw_1227737925_22" class="yshortcuts">Mumbai</span>'s stock exchange, trains, hotels and gas stations. Authorities say those attacks, which killed 257 people and wounded more than 1,100, were carried out to avenge the deaths of hundreds of Muslims in religious riots that had swept India. </font>

<font face="Verdana">Ten years later, in 2003, 52 people were killed in <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227737925_23" class="yshortcuts">Mumbai bombings</span> blamed on Muslim militants and in July 2007 a series of seven blasts on railway trains and at <span id="lw_1227737925_24" class="yshortcuts">commuter rail stations</span> killed at least 187. </font>

<font face="Verdana">Relations between <span id="lw_1227737925_25" class="yshortcuts">Hindus</span>, who make up more than 80 percent of India's 1 billion population, and Muslims, who make up about 14 percent, have sporadically erupted into bouts of <span id="lw_1227737925_26" class="yshortcuts">sectarian violence</span> since British-ruled India was split into independent India and Pakistan in 1947.</font>
