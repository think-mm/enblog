<font size="4">This is a shame that I live in a 'Red State', which again will go for the Republican ticket. I went to the polling place at 6:30 am thinking that I will be done casting my vote in 30 minutes just like as I have done before. However, when we reached at the polling place I saw at least 250 people ahead of me standing in line. It took us (my wife and my college-going daughter) more than two and a half hour to cast the vote.</font>

<font size="4">I live in the suburb, which always votes for the Republican ticket. However, this time I saw many <span id="lw_1225856684_1" class="yshortcuts">African American</span> and Hispanic voters. I never knew that so many minority Americans live in my voting district. Also, there were many young college-going kids standing in the line. My daughter saw a few of her college friends who were expected to vote for Obama. </font>

<font size="4">When it is all said and done, Louisiana will vote for <span id="lw_1225856684_2" class="yshortcuts">McCain</span>. I am now sitting in front of my TV listening to CNN's Election Center. By 6:00 pm the CNN declared that Vermont (with 3 <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1225856684_3" class="yshortcuts">electoral votes</span>) have gone for Obama (No surprise there!). And Kentucky (11 electoral votes) has gone for McCain. Again, there is no surprise.</font>

<font size="4">All eyes at CNN were on Indiana and Virginia where voting ended. Early return shows that Obama is running very strong in Indiana even though he is traililng by a few thousand votes. Incidentally, these returns are coming from Republican dominated counties. In <span id="lw_1225856684_4" class="yshortcuts">Florida</span> as of this writing Obama has a lead when only 1% precinct was reported. In Virginia the case is a different one where early returns show more votes for McCain because these returns are coming from rural counties.</font>

<font size="4">All indications are that Obama will do extremely well tonight. </font>

<font size="4">My lamentation is that I live in a Republican state (Red State) and I don't know how long will it take to make this state a Blue one.</font>

<font size="4">By the way, nationally, Obama is getting 51% of the vote and McCain is garnering 48% (with 1% of the total votes reporting).  Also, in Florida with only 3% precinct reporting, Obama is ahead with 143,000 more votes.  The election night is still young and things are looking good for Obama!  Mr. Sitangshu Guha should watch these developments with a wide eye!  After tonight, the jokes are going to be on him.</font>
