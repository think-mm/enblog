American Atheists Condemn  the Decision to Include God in the 2012 Democratic National Platform

Cranford, NJ—On Wednesday, American Atheists officially condemned the amendment that was passed to include the word god into the 2012 Democratic National Platform. The measure, led by Former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland, brought a vote before the convention delegates, requesting the official platform include the term god, and recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The motion was not unanimous and was protested by some delegates, but was adopted after three voice votes by the official delegates.

The new language for the 2012 Democratic National Platform reads, "We need a government that stands up for the hopes, values, and interests of working people, and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God–given potential."

David Silverman, President of American Atheists said, "I am shocked that the Democratic Party caved in to the pressure they were receiving because of their choice to use inclusive language in their platform." Silverman continues, "This decision makes the Democratic Party look less like the 'party of all people' and only the party of those who are religious." 

American Atheists officially stand in opposition to this divisive decision made by the Democratic Party. We urge the leadership to reconsider this action, which unnecessarily alienates about 16% of the American voting population.

 

AMERICAN ATHEISTS is a national 501(c)(3) organization that defends civil rights for atheists, freethinkers, and other nonbelievers; works for the total separation of religion and government; and addresses issues of First Amendment public policy.
