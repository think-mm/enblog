<h3 class="post-title entry-title">From time to time religious people claim that atheism is a religion too [1]. This is strange for - at least - two reasons. First of all; how can the absence of something be this very thing? How can the absence of religion be a religion? And, secondly, how come religious people take the right to define atheism from their world-view, i.e., that everybody has to have a belief?</h3>
<div id="post-body-8582042409649294283" class="post-body entry-content">
<b>The latter actually reflects the problem we are facing here rather well. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_religious_groups">a vast majority of the worlds population is religious</a> of some sort, religious people simply <i>take</i> the right to define <i>the</i> reference frame from which to judge <i>everyone's</i>views on <i>their own</i> religious beliefs.</b>

This reference frame, sort of, sits in the word "atheism" itself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">Atheism </a>is defined about theism. It should be the other way round. Let's illustrate this by trying to replace the word "atheism" with a different name, e.g., "freethinker" [2]. If we call all people that are free from religion freethinkers than Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hinduists, Jews, Shintoists, etc., are afreethinkers or non-freethinkers.

Get the point? Hope so. But let's take a one more example. Ghosts. I know that many people <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ghosts">believe in ghosts</a>, but the vast majority does not [3]. Hence, you would assume that someone you just met somewhere in the street does not believe in ghosts. You might, however, eventually find that this person actually <i>does</i> believe in ghost [4]. Now, the question is: how many people would have to believe in ghosts to swing the balance, so that is you that has to <i>come out</i> as an "aghostic"?

<b>Since repetition seems to be <a href="https://edtechnow.net/2013/05/12/pedagogy/">a useful concept in pedagogics</a>, let's add yet another example. Science. If I am supposed to "believe" in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson">Higgs particle</a> (yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Nickname">pun intended</a>), I reasonably ask for the evidence (see, e.g., <a href="https://home.cern/topics/higgs-boson">here</a> for the current status). Similar to so fantastic a thing as <a href="https://www.ligo.org/science/Publication-GW150914/index.php">gravitational waves</a> [5]. Now, if I tell you there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_teapot">teapot</a> in some orbit around the sun, and you do not believe me, how would you feel if I tried to define your non-believing in the existence of this teapot by calling you an ateapotist and claim that your non-belief in the teapot is as good as mine, i.e., it too is "a belief"?</b>

Well, this is the classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof">burden of proof</a> problem. In the case of the teapot or the ghost, most people will see the point. But when it comes to religion the claim that atheism is a religion too remains widespread.

<b>But it is nevertheless false.</b>

Notes:

[1] Religious people do, of course, their best to spread this claim which I see as nothing but cheap propaganda. Guess it helps them to reduce their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonances</a> and makes them feel better. A recent example from Sweden is found <a href="https://www.svd.se/scientismen-tolererar-bara-sin-egen-tro/om/kultur:under-strecket">here</a>. A good comment and some background on this article by Jonna Bornemark are given by <a href="https://blog.lindenfors.se/index.php/2016/03/02/flest-fel-i-en-understreckare-nagonsin-scientismen-tolererar-bara-sin-egen-tro-eller-i-fablernas-varld/">Patrik Lindenfors</a>.
[2] I don't think this is a right word in this context and in a way the word "freethinker" contains the same problem as "atheist", but, for the sake of the argument, let's use it here.
[3] Though I might be wrong with my "<a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/mind-mood/why-people-believe-in-ghosts">significant majority</a>" believe here.
[4] And you might be okay with it as long as the person does not try to convince you and does not do you any harm based on this ghost-believing thing.
[5] Wow, look at the list of authors at the end of this <a href="https://physics.aps.org/featured-article-pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102">paper</a> and compare it with the author list of some "holy" scripture ...</div>
