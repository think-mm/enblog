It is almost universally accepted by the Muslims, but not necessarily by all 100 per cent of Muslims, that every bit of Islamic teaching in the form of verses, as depicted in the Holy Quran, is the direct message from the all powerful, omnipresent, omniscient Allah through His messenger Prophet Mohammad (pbuh). As these teachings are direct revelations from Allah, they are the absolute and ultimate truth and nothing can or should be done ever to change or reform these revelations. That is why Islam remains frozen for the last 1400 years or so.

When Quran asks: who is it that sends down water from the skies? The answer comes: surely it must be Allah. Quran claims that Allah created the human being (Adam) from a drop of sperm. Allah created heaven and earth and everything in between at the beginning. Scientific facts and evidence contradict such assertions and revelations.

There are innumerable historical facts which are at variance with Quranic revelations and Islamic teachings. Just look at the video clip and you may have a view different from the theological view. There is nothing wrong in accepting or assimilating different views and ideas. But denying assimilation and claiming originality as revelation is what is questionable here.
