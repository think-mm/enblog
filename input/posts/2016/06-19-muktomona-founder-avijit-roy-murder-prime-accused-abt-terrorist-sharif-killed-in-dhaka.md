Prime suspect of the murder of Avijit Roy, the Mukto-Mona founder and writer, has been killed in a "gunfight" with the Detective Branch (DB) of police in Khilgaon area of Dhaka. His name is Sharif alias Hadi. He was a member of the AL-Queda Indian Sub-continent affiliated Bangladeshi Islamic terrorist group Ansar Bangla, confirmed the DMP Deputy Commissioner Masudur Rahman.

Sharif and one of his friend were passing through the Khilgao area in Dhaka City on a motorbike Sunday at 2.00 AM. "They opened fire at DB police when the law enforcers challenged them," told DMP Deputy Commissioner.

On May 19, Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) announced 500,000 BDT bounty on Sharif.

MuktoMona founder Avijit Roy was hacked to death by assailants near the Teacher Student Center at Dhaka University on February 26, 2015.
