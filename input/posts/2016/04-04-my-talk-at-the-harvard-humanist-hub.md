I was honored to talk at the Harvard humanist Hub yesterday. The first part of the talk was very similar to the one I delivered in London for the Voltaire Lecture arranged by  British Humanist Association, in 2015. In the second half of the talk, I tried to speak to the humanist community worldwide, and in particular humanists in the United States. I tried to formulate a broader and unified vision for how the humanist community should deal with the challenges of this century. It was a hard task to capture so many things in a 30-40 minute talk - introducing Bangladesh and its unique history, describing the rise of Islamism there, explaining why it is relevant to what is happening here in the USA, and finally sharing my opinions on what the humanist community must do to deal with this global phenomenon.
