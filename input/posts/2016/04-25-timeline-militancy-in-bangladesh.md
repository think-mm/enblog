This post contains the names of Islamist militant organizations – both banned and blacklisted; radical groups and individuals who instigate murder of atheists, secularists and other non-Sunni Muslims; and the description of attacks and deaths committed so far.

Note that all the local armed and unarmed extremist groups are currently working together with the help of regional and international militant groups towards a single target – turning Bangladesh into a Shariah-based country by eliminating the secular and the reformist Muslim groups – an agenda hatched by war criminal party Jamaat-e-Islami and executed by Islami Chhatra Shibir.
