It is another sad day for humanity. The editorial board of Muktomona condemns the mindless killing of innocent people, Christian or otherwise, in Sri Lanka. We also say the remedy of religious fanaticism is not more religion, especially not the institutional religion, but rather the remedy is the creation of open minds that accept various ways of living that do not harm each other. Let parents allow their children to grow up in an open environment so that they can choose their own path based on knowledge, logic and humanity. Spirituality does not come from blind faith; it comes from in-depth understanding of this universe.
