As you might already know, The Bobs --- Best of Online Activism 2015 --- has given a jury award in the category of "Social Change"</a> to <strong>Mukto-Mona</strong>. Adelheid Feilcke, Head of Partnership and Project Management of DEUTSCHE WELLE (DW), has sent the following letter to Bonya Ahmed inviting her to the reception ceremony of the award on behalf of Mukto-Mona. The award ceremony will be held in Bonn, Germany on 23 June, 2015.

<blockquote>13.05.2015

Dear Mrs. Ahmed,

Please allow me to express my heartfelt condolences. Your husband's death shocked everyone at DEUTSCHE WELLE (DW) and has left us with a deep sense of loss. Avijit Roy's work on behalf of a secular society in Bangladesh was a remarkable achievement which required courage and determination. The price your late husband paid for his writing is utterly shocking and completely unacceptable.

We would therefore like to take this opportunity to inform you that in recognition of your late husband's work and your work, <a href="https://thebobs.com/english/category/2015/?only_winners=true">The Bobs --- Best of Online Activism 2015 --- has given a jury award in the category of "Social Change"</a> to the <strong>Mukto-Mona</strong> blogging site.

As you know, DW has been reporting on the activities of bloggers in Bangladesh since 2009. After the brutal murder of Avijit Roy on February 26, 2015, DW Editor-in-Chief Alexander Kudascheff spoke of "an abhorrent crime" and pointed out that "there are severe restrictions on freedom of speech and freedom of the press in Bangladesh. Courageous journalists and writers, who take a critical stance on religious issues, face hostility and live in constant danger. Therefore, DW, with its Bengali Service, offers a platform for those voices that are not being heard in Bangladesh."

Now that The Bobs has awarded this important prize to the Mukto-Mona blogging site, we hope more people will become aware of the important contribution your husband and yourself have made to securing freedom of expression in your country.

Therefore, on behalf of DW, and in recognition of your late husband's work, it gives me great pleasure to invite you to the winners' ceremony in Bonn, Germany. The ceremony will take place at the "Global Media Forum", an international media conference organized by DW from June 22 to June 24, 2015.

Since the German media is very anxious to meet you and to interview you we would ask you to be available in Bonn on June 23 at 10 a.m. at the latest. You may attend the entire conference or just the Award Ceremony on June 23. 

It would be wonderful if you could attend the Award Ceremony of The Bobs --- Best of Online Activism 2015. All necessary expenses will of course be borne by DEUTSCHE WELLE.

I am looking forward to meeting you in person in Bonn so that I can learn more about your work and your efforts to foster freedom of speech in your country. 

Yours truly,
Adelheid Feilcke
Head of Partnership and Project Management
DEUTSCHE WELLE
