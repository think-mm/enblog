## Public rally/tribute "Standing With Avijit" on March 21, 3pm

**Washington, DC** - Drishtipat DC announces the "Standing with Avijit" rally to take place March 21, 2015 from 3 PM to 5 PM at the Dupont Circle Fountain in Washington, DC.

On February 26, 2015, Bangladeshi-American humanist writer and blogger Avijit Roy was hacked to death by religious hardliners in Dhaka, Bangladesh. His wife Bonya Ahmed, who is also a writer and blogger, was left critically injured in the attack.  The attack drew broad condemnation worldwide.  The killing is one in a pattern of several attacks on secularists by extremists in Bangladesh.

"We are here to rally, to stand with Avijit and Bonya. We are united in our grief and outrage. We urge the government of Bangladesh to conduct a swift and thorough investigation. We call on everyone to come stand with us for free speech and secularism in Bangladesh," said Drishtipat DC.

This outdoor rally is open to the public and will include a moment of silence, readings, and songs.  Drishtipat DC is an all-volunteer network promoting human rights and social justice in Bangladesh. Follow us on Facebook at https://on.fb.me/1BimRWy or email us at *DC.Drishtipat at gmail dot com*
