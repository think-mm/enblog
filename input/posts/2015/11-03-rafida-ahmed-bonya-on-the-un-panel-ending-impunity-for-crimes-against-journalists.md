<p style="text-align: left;">The United Nations General Assembly adopted <a href="https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/68/163" target="_blank">Resolution A/RES/68/163</a> at its 68th session in 2013 which proclaimed 2 November as the 'International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists' (IDEI). The Resolution urged Member States to implement definite measures countering the present culture of impunity. The date was chosen in commemoration of the assassination of two French journalists in Mali on 2 November 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The panel was organized on the 2nd International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, and just 2 days after the attacks on Avijit's publishers Faisal Arefin Dipon and Ahmedur Rashid Tutul, the attack that killed Dipon.</p>
