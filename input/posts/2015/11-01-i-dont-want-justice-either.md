Like the father of publisher Faisal Arefin Dipan, slain blogger Avijit Roy's wife Rafida Ahmed Banya does not seek justice for the murders of the bloggers and publishers.

"I surely know that the wives of Tutul and Dipan, sister of Ananta, and friends of Rajib, Babu and Niloy do not want justice too," Banya, also a blogger of Muktamona, wrote in her blog out of frustration today, a day after the synchronised attacks on publishers of slain secularist writer-blogger Avijit.

Unknown assailants hacked Faisal Arefin Dipan of Jagriti Prokashani to death and critically injured Shuddhoswar's Ahmedur Rashid Tutul and bloggers Tareq and Ranadipam.
