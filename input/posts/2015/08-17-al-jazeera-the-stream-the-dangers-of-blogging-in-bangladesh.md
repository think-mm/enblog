<strong>From "The Stream" <a href="https://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201508172128-0024953">website</a>.</strong>

Attackers hacked to death a fourth secular blogger in Bangladesh. For the country's blogging community, this year's murders are seen as assaults on free thought and the freedom to criticise religious extremism. Rights advocates say the government's indifference to the bloggers' safety is rooted in Bangladesh's long struggle with being a Muslim-majority country founded by secular ideals.
