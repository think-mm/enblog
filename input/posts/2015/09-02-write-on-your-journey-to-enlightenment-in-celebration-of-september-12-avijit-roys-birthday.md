September 12, 2015, is the 44th birthday of Avijit Roy, the secular, humanist writer. Before he was murdered by Islamists this February, the founder of the Mutko-Mona platform Avijit Roy was involved in furthering many issues including science, free thought, humanism, and literature. He not only wrote online, he also introduced the free thought movement in Bangladesh to the international arena. Avijit Roy wrote and edited ten books in Bengali. He was, and will remain, a true friend to freethinkers, and liberals everywhere.

Inspired by Avijit Roy's writings, many people began writing themselves, and creating protest against injustice. So to commemorate his birthday, write about your journey toward secular humanism, about yourself, about Avijit Roy, about Mukto-Mona, about freethinking. Question yourself, and your surroundings, for yourself, for future generations, for the furtherance of humankind.

On September 12, Mukto-Mona will publish your writings to inaugurate the special section dedicated to Avijit Roy to honor his birthday. Selected writings will later be anthologized and published as an e-book as well as in print. The e-book will be published in late September 2015, and the print anthology in February 2016, at the Ekushey Boimela.
