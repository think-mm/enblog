From: Arif Rahman.

Do religions diminish free speech?

Blasphemy laws were scrapped in Britain in 2008, but remain in Northern Ireland. Iceland has become the latest country to repeal their blasphemy laws this month. Has Britain got the balance right? Is blasphemy an outdated concept? Does following a religion suppress your freedoms? Or can religion and free speech co-exist? The panel are joined by chief executive of the British Humanist Association Andrew Copson.
