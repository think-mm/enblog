It is with utmost concern we observe that David Griffiths, Amnesty International's South Asia Research Director, has issued a statement describing the death penalty given to the 1971 war criminals Mohammed Mojaheed and Salauddin Quader Chowdhury as the ultimate miscarriage of justice. 

In the words of Amnesty International:

<blockquote>Two opposition politicians face imminent hanging for crimes committed during the 1971 Independence War after serious flaws occurred in their trial and appeal processes. In 2013 Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and Salauddin Quader Chowdhury were sentenced to death by the country's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on charges of war crimes and genocide at trials that failed to meet international standards for fair trial.</blockquote>

We are baffled by the stand that the Amnesty International has taken with respect to the war crimes trial in Bangladesh. If Amnesty truly had a South Asian research wing, it would have found, on its own, that the charges against these two war criminals were well founded and the justice is long overdue. 

In 1971, Salauddin Quader (SQ) Chowdhury was the chief architect of terror in the Chittagong area who actively supported the Pakistani Army in their killings Bengali population, especially of Hindus. During the same time period, Mohammed Mojaheed was the chief of the Islamist para-military force Al-Badr responsible for murdering intellectuals. 

Without summarizing their part in committing genocide and rape here, we attach, at the end of this article, the charges that were brought against these two individuals and the specific ones for which they were found guilty. Only after reading these charges one can be aware of the depth of brutality that these individuals had shown.     

We understand that, in the past, AI had an honorable history in terms of coming to the aid for the prisoners of conscience all over the world. However, in recent years, AI has routinely bypassed issues that involve major human rights violation.

We think Amnesty International does not have a comprehensive approach to the current global human rights problem. It might tentatively issue a campaign call to urge Barack Obama to take bolder stand against Boko Haram in Nigeria, but will not follow through. It might pay lip service against the brutality of ISIS, but does not have resolve to do anything constructive to stop the ISIS mayhem.

Instead, AI has decided to concentrate its power in defense of some of the worst offenders of human rights in history, i.e., Mojaheed and SQ Chowdhury. We should not be surprised, after all, its AI which had once forged ties with Islamist organizations such as CAGE, an unabashedly Taliban supporting entity. 

The most disappointing is the part of the statement, where AI denounces the freedom fighters of 1971 stating that human rights violation was also committed by pro-independence forces. With this declaration, AI has virtually equated the honorable struggle of a people with genocide and rape committed by a murderous force. It is a long fall from grace for Amnesty International.

It is quite intriguing that AI, from the very beginning, has tried to undermine the Bangladesh ICT process. We don't know why, but we urge AI to do their homework first before plunging into things that they do not understand. If they were a responsible organization they should have done their own research and would have found, on their own, what Mojaheed and SQ Chowdhury did during 1971.

We understand that AI has a policy against death penalty. AI could have requested the Bangladesh Government to commute the death penalty awarded to these war criminals in exchange for life sentences. Instead AI has questioned the validity of the entire trial procedure. In our opinion, this portrays a biased view that AI harbors about the liberation war in Bangladesh. It has chosen to minimize the level of inhumanity that Bengalis suffered at the hands Pakistani Army and their local collaborators. AI has taken the side of the murderers and rapists. We are deeply disappointed to say the least. We decry the AI statement.

<em>Charges against Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed:</em>

The International Crimes Tribunal on Jul 17, 2013, ordered Mojaheed to capital punishment for the massacre of the intellectuals and involvement in the murder and torture of Hindus during the War of Independence.
Out of the seven charges leveled against him, the tribunal had found him guilty on five counts. He was given the death penalty in the first, sixth and seventh charges. Mojaheed (or Mujaheed) got life in prison for the fifth charge. The Supreme Court upheld the war crimes tribunal's verdict on this charge.

1. The first charge brought by the Prosecution says Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujaheed, the leader of Islami Chhatra Sangha, was involved in the abduction of Sirajuddin Hossain, the then Executive Editor of the daily Ittefaq, on gunpoint as Hossain had written a newspaper article against the local agents of Pakistani Army.

On Dec 10, 1971, some seven to eight masked youths, armed with rifles abducted the journalist from his house at 5, Chamelibag, Dhaka. He had never returned since then nor was his body found.

One day in mid-May, 1971, the Pakistan Army and its local collaborators raided and torched some 300 houses belonged to people of Hindu community in Baidyadangi, Majhidangi, Baladangi villages under Faridpur's Charvodrason Police Station. Some 50 to 60 people were also gunned down by the attackers. Apart from Hammad Maulana of Faridpur town, some 8-10 non- Bengalis also took part in that operation against the unarmed people.

Mujaheed has been charged for his involvement in assisting and instigating the attack on a particular community as it is a punishable crime as per the sections 3(2)(a)(c)(G) and 4(1) of the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973.
