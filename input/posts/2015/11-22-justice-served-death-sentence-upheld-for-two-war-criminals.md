During the early morning hours of November 22, Bangladesh carried out the death sentences for two notorious war criminals of 1971. They were Salahuddin Quader (SQ) Chowdhury and Ali Ahsam Mohammed Mujahid (or Mojaheed). 

The convicted were accused of taking part in mass murders and assassinations of innocent Bengalis during the 1971 liberation struggle against Pakistan. Both SQ Chowdhury and Mujahid were rehabilitated in politics by two former Bangladesh Presidents, Ziaur Rahman and Hossain Ershad, after the killing of the founding leader of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1971. 

It is quite bewildering to the people of Bangladesh that the western press and human rights organizations kept referring to these two convicted people as opposition leaders and not war criminals. It is also quite frustrating to see the myopic vision of the United States with respect to its foreign policy; it bombs ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but at the same time issues statements in support of these criminals in Bangladesh who, through their actions, were no less than ISIS terrorists.
 
We consider the carrying out of the verdict against these two war criminals as a step towards achieving some closure for the injustice that the Bengalis suffered during 1971. Forty four years have passed since 1971, many of the perpetrators of crime have died without facing charges. The surviving Pakistani Army officers and soldiers who carried out the bulk of the atrocity, including genocide and mass rape, remain outside the jurisdiction. However, we consider this verdict by the International War Crimes Tribunal and its execution by the Bangladesh Government a proxy indictment for all war criminals of 1971.

Below we provide the charges brought against the convicted; without reading them you would not get the total scope of the heinous acts committed by SQ Chowdhury and Mujahid.

<em>Charges against Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid (or Mojaheed):

The International Crimes Tribunal on Jul 17, 2013, ordered Mojaheed to capital punishment for the massacre of the intellectuals and involvement in the murder and torture of Hindus during the War of Independence.
Out of the seven charges leveled against him, the tribunal had found him guilty on five counts. He was given the death penalty in the first, sixth and seventh charges. Mojaheed (or Mujaheed) got life in prison for the fifth charge. The Supreme Court upheld the war crimes tribunal's verdict on this charge.

1. The first charge brought by the Prosecution says Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujaheed, the leader of Islami Chhatra Sangha, was involved in the abduction of Sirajuddin Hossain, the then Executive Editor of the daily Ittefaq, on gunpoint as Hossain had written a newspaper article against the local agents of Pakistani Army.

Some 50 to 60 people were also gunned down by the attackers. Apart from Hammad Maulana of Faridpur town, some 8-10 non- Bengalis also took part in that operation against the unarmed people.

Mujaheed has been charged for his involvement in assisting and instigating the attack on a particular community as it is a punishable crime as per the sections 3(2)(a)(c)(G) and 4(1) of the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973.

4. Razakars abducted one Mohammad Yusuf alias Pakhi of East Goalchamat Khoda Bakshpur, PS: Kotwali, district: Faridpur from Alfadanga locality on July 26, 1971, suspecting him to be a freedom fighter.
