As per the news report from Kolkata (India), Mr Salman Rushdie was not allowed to visit the city on 1st February 2013 for promoting the film based on his novel 'Midnight's Children'. The over-enthusiastic and "look-at-me Islamo-philic" Chief Minister of the Indian state, Ms Mamata Banerjee, has asked her police not to let Mr Rushdie enter Kolkata. The reason is obvious as _Ulema_ consider Rhusdie's writing to be blasphemous. Moreover, Rushdie is an apostate from Islam. The _Sharia_ (Laws of Allah) is specifically cruel for such person. Some years back Ms Taslima Nasreen was bundled out of Kolkata for her  blasphemous writings. The ruling dispositions of West Bengal have been too eager to pamper the _Ulema_. In both cases, decisions were taken so that Muslim sentiment is not hurt. Let us examine what that Muslim sentiment is. 

Prophet said "Paradise is at the feet of mother". But as per Islamic laws, this mother's (women) testimony is half worthy of father's (man). So how can one reconcile with this contradiction? The moment such question is posed, the _Ulema_ behave in a century old stereotype manner. If the questioner is a Muslim he will called a blasphemous and death penalty will be imposed on him. However, if he is a non-Muslim then he will be reminded of being a _kafir_ and enemy of Islam. The original question will never be addressed or answered. In stead, _Ulema_ will instigate common Muslims for protests and violent activities to save Islam. But how Islam can be in danger in the face of a few basic questions? Mr Rushdie and Ms Taslima had raised some basic doubts and questions about the Allah sent religion in their writings. Ms Taslima was direct in her approach while Mr Rushdie was indirect. That is why they are _personas non gratae_ in Kolkata. 

Islam was not a straight jacket like this in its early phase. _Ijtihad_ was in practice then. However, about two centuries following the death of Prophet, the door of _Ijtihad_ was permanently closed by _Ulema_. The reason given was that no pious Muslim could ever be available to deliberate in _Ijtihad_. This self down-grading of _Ulema_ served the political and imperialistic purposes of Islam. The _Khalifas_, who had expansionist zeal and motive needed early Muslims to be only like soldiers of Allah, i.e "they are not to make reply, they are not to reason why, they are but to do and die". The _Ulema_ who were sponsored by _Khalifas_ came out with this solution. Islam no more needed intellectual contemplation on contentious issues. Islam needed unquestionable faith and muscle power. In the process _Ulema_ also became very powerful. So it was a power game and had nothing to do with _Qur'an_, _Hadith_ and _Sunnah_. In the instant case, sentiment of common Muslims is nowhere. It is the issue of ego satisfaction of power hungry _Ulema_.

In Indian subcontinent, we have seen many prominent Islamic scholars who tried to rationalize Islam through _Ijtihad_. They included Sir Seyd Ahmed Khan, Allama Iqbal, Abul Kalam Azad and Dr Zakir Hussain. Unfortunately, under the mounting pressure and criticism from the _Ulema_, all of them retracted back latter. Sir Sayd Ahmed was even called _Kafir_ by _Ulema_.

In independent India, political leaders some time behave in most funny manner to ensure the supposed Muslim vote bank. Ms Mamata Banerjee has only done so. All sane people should condemn this foolish and short sighted action by the West Bengal Chief Minister. 

We are really sorry and ashamed Mr Rushdie. Your right to visit Kolkata has been violated by some vested interests in much publicized but hollow cultural capital of India.
