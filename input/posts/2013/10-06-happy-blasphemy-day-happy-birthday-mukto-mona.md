<em><a href="https://blog.muktomona.com/?p=37591">I wrote a piece in Bengali</a> on Blasphemy day, 2013.  I could not find time earlier to post this in English blog. Here it is:  </em>

-----------------------

Today is September 30<sup>th</sup>, also known as <i>Blasphemy Rights day</i>.  This day is dedicated to those who are systematically being persecuted, harassed, or killed for their simple expression of Freethought (more precisely, for their 'blasphemous' views towards religion).

In medieval ages "blasphemy" was equated with sin, as it was considered an insult to a deity or Holy Scripture. But as time progressed, we apparently became more civilized by promoting the idea that any belief should be open to examination and taboo-free. In most progressive parts of today's world, particularly in Europe and North America, the old blasphemy laws have been overturned. However, few other parts of the world have retained social ideas that are reminiscent of the mediaeval age. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Bangladesh are some prime examples. In Bangladesh, as we already know, several bloggers were recently put behind bars on the sole basis that they were openly atheist (Pls. refer to <a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/?p=2438">my write up published in current issue of Free Inquiry Magazine</a> on this topic). In Pakistan (as from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom report), at least 203 incidents of violence in the name of religion have resulted in some 1,800 casualties and more than 700 deaths in just the last 18 months. These Islamic countries, based on their religious legal code known as <i>Sharia</i>, are deeply anti-woman as well. Recently, a 19-year-old gang rape victim (yes, you read right – rape victim, not the rapist) was sentenced to 200 lashes and to six months in jail for the crime of indecency and speaking to the press in Saudi Arabia (read <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/world/middleeast/16saudi.html?_r=1">here</a>). In another incident, Raif Badawi, a blogger in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes on charges of blasphemy (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-57596285/saudi-arabia-sentences-blogger-to-7-years-in-prison-600-lashes-for-encouraging-religious-debate/">here</a>). The nonbelievers in these Islamic countries face the most severe treatment at the hands of both mullahs and the state.

Today, we state clearly that considering apostasy to be a criminal offense in state level in fact is an inexcusable offense. If being religious is someone's right, then being critical to religion is also one's right.  There is nothing wrong to be critical to any idea or ideology, as CFI aptly put on its Blasphemy day banner - 'Ideas do not need rights, People do'!

I wished I would write more on this year's celebration of blasphemy day, but one unexpected email changed the entire theme of my planned write-up. The email arrived from Patuakhali, one of the remote districts in South-western Bangladesh:
<blockquote>"Every human being wants to be happy; but if we don't know how to find a way to walk the road of happiness then we will just grow up naturally and die someday without getting the taste of real happiness.

Few years ago, I was desperately looking for a way to find the path of happiness. I guess I have found it at last. Now I know the real happiness is reading "Mukto-Mona [Freethinker] blog" every day.  The real feeling is to know the truth and all I have got from you. I'm really thankful to you for showing the right path. I wish your happiness and bright future always".</blockquote>
However, it was the last paragraph of the email that really touched my heart. It says:
<blockquote>I have a daughter. As a mark of respect to you and your creation - Mukto-Mona blog, I call her 'Muktomona' [freethinker is Bengali] as well. She is two years old now. I will try my best to make her real muktomona I look forward to my daughter growing up and one day asking me, among the millions of names, why did I pick and choose her name 'muktomona'.  That day I would tell her about you and show her your site and explain -'That's why'!

This was a wonderful gift for me on 'Blasphemy day'. I founded this 'blasphemous site' Mukto-Mona (<a href="https://muktomona.com">www.muktomona.com</a>) in the year of 2001, with a singular intention: to debate and discuss on controversial, but utterly important issues.  Only with this principle, I thought, can the construction of a progressive, rational and secular society be possible in mainstream Bangladesh and South Asia. I was proud of MM's growing popularity in the progressive community over the years, but I never imagined that a person from remote Pauakhali would one day inspired one day so much that he would name his little girl 'Mukto-Mona'.

What a pleasant surprise! I hope just as her name suggests, the little girl will  one day grow up to be a 'blasphemous' freethinker.  I hope she maintains an  inquisitive mind throughout her life, and will be a wonderful person and that she will enhance her life with an ethical, scientific, and philosophical outlook.  I wish her all the best.

Happy blasphemy day 2013. We will celebrate the day as 'Mukto-Mona Day'  from now on.
