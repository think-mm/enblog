[<span style="color: #ff0000;">An eight-story building collapsed Wednesday in Savar, an outskirts of the Bangladeshi capital, killing at least 123 people and injuring more than 1,000. Due to the National Day of Mourning in Bangladesh on April 25, protests have been postponed to <b>May 2</b>.</span>]

An international coalition of atheist and humanist organizations, led by the Center for Inquiry and our partners the International Humanist and Ethical Union and American Atheists, will protest the arrest and persecution of atheist bloggers and other dissenters in Bangladesh with demonstrations in New York City, Washington, D.C., London, Ottawa, and other cities around the world on Thursday, May 2.

Bangladesh has recently been at the center of a human rights crisis as authorities have detained several prominent atheist bloggers for "hurting religious sentiments," followed by the arrest of a newspaper editor who printed quotations from the targeted bloggers, and two more young people for making "derogatory remarks" about Islam on Facebook. Tens of thousands of people have rallied in the country's capital to demand more arrests, tougher blasphemy laws, and have threatened violence if their demands are not met by April 25.

With these unprecedented demonstrations, secularists around the world will express their solidarity with those jailed for speaking their minds about religion. Protesters will draw global attention to the plight of those persecuted for exercising their rights to freedom of belief and expression, and attempt to spur the international community to take action and compel the government of Bangladesh to change course.

"The events in Bangladesh are only the latest instance of a fierce global crackdown on 'blasphemy,' with the criminalization of atheism and religious dissent," said protest coordinator Michael De Dora, director of CFI's Office of Public Policy. "To all those who believe that the freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, we call upon you to join us, religious believer and atheist alike. We can show those whose lives and freedoms are threatened that they are not forgotten, and send a message to these oppressive regimes that their abuses will not be ignored."
