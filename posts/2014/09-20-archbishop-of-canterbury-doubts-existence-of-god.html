<p><strong>Archbishop of Canterbury admits doubts about existence of God</strong>
Justin Welby tells BBC radio interviewer there are moments when he doubts – but he is certain about the existence of Jesus</p>

The archbishop of Canterbury has admitted to having doubts about the existence of God and disclosed that, on a recent morning jog with his dog, he questioned why the Almighty had failed to intervene to prevent an injustice.</p>
<p>In a light-hearted but personal interview in front of hundreds of people in Bristol cathedral last weekend, Justin Welby said: &quot;There are moments, sure, where you think 'Is there a God? Where is God?'&quot;Welby quickly added that, as the leader of the world's 80 million-strong Anglican community, this was &quot;probably not what the archbishop of Canterbury should say&quot;.</p>
<p>Footage of the archbishop of Canterbury's interview
Earlier, BBC Bristol's Lucy Tegg, the interviewer, reminded him of the weight his words carried. &quot;You have a remarkably prominent role within the faith community around the world,&quot; Tegg said.</p>
<p>&quot;I've noticed,&quot; Welby quipped.</p>
<p>Tegg then asked: &quot;Do you ever doubt?&quot;</p>
<p>Welby replied: &quot;Yes. I do. In lots of different ways really. It's a very good question. That means I've got to think about what I'm going to say. Yes I do.&quot; He added: &quot;I love the Psalms, if you look at Psalm 88, that's full of doubt.&quot;</p>
<p>Welby suggested that his doubts were a regular occurrence, by recounting the recent morning run with his dog.</p>
<p>&quot;The other day I was praying as I was running and I ended up saying to God: 'Look, this is all very well but isn't it about time you did something – if you're there' – which is probably not what the archbishop of Canterbury should say.&quot; He added: &quot;It is not about feelings, it is about the fact that God is faithful and the extraordinary thing about being a Christian is that God is faithful when we are not.&quot;</p>
<p>Later in the interview, Welby said he was certain, however, about the existence of Jesus, even talking about his presence beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;We know about Jesus, we can't explain all the questions in the world, we can't explain about suffering, we can't explain loads of things but we know about Jesus,&quot; Welby said. &quot;We can talk about Jesus – I always do that because most of the other questions I can't answer.&quot; Asked what he did when life got challenging, Welby said: &quot;I keep going and call to Jesus to help me, and he picks me up.&quot;</p>
<p>Welby, who was appointed to his post in November 2012, has frequently made known his feelings on a wide variety of issues. He has raised questions about the &quot;inexplicable&quot; increase in energy prices, which he has said are putting strain on low-income households.</p>
<p>He has criticised government changes to welfare and targeted payday lenders, saying that he wanted to &quot;compete Wonga out of existence&quot;, although it was later pointed out that at the time the church was an investor in Wonga.</p>
<p>He has also offered wholehearted support for the consecration of women bishops, describing the rejection in 2012 as a &quot;grim day&quot;.</p>
