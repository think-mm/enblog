        <p>I'm a lesbian.</p>
<p>Yeah I know what you are thinking. Some of you are thinking &quot;Okay, that's cool!&quot; while many of you are not thinking along those lines. But before I go further, let me tell you me being a lesbian is not cool. You don't say someone is cool because of their sexuality. That's just weird.</p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;She must really hate guys!&quot; No, I actually like men because they understand my problems better. They know how much courage it takes to walk up to girls we like and say &quot;Hi!&quot; They know how nervous we can be when we are waiting for a response to a text we have just send to our crushes. They know how awful it feels to get our hearts broken and crushed by girls.</p>
<p><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qb0g951KYpM/UnnqRAAKgPI/AAAAAAAAACM/_fTIq3QDbh8/s1600/heartbroken-sad-songs-12767085-288-396.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;She must have got her poor heart broken by a douchebag and now she's a lesbian&quot; No, I have not had a disastrous relationship with a guy. And yes, it's true I have never had a serious relationship with a guy either. It's also true I have never kissed a guy. But that's not the reason I'm a lesbian. Understand the cause and effect here. I did not &quot;become&quot; a lesbian because I'm a failure with men. I'm a failure with men because I'm a lesbian.</p>
<p>Speaking of douchebags, some people here are thinking &quot;She will change her mind if she gets to meet a real man like me&quot;. No, I would not turn straight if I get it on with a &quot;real&quot; man. I don't want to get it on with any men- real or not. I'm very happy being with girls. No man can give me what a woman can. For example, boobs. Men cannot give me boobs- unless it's manboobs- which I don't find to be that pretty.</p>
<p>Some of you girls are thinking &quot;Oh my God I have to keep away from her evil eyes!&quot; I don't check out every girl I see. Yeah sometimes, when a pretty girl walks by I find it difficult to avert my eyes; that's about it. I don't hit on every girl there is; especially straight girls. I don't make uncomfortable comments or touch any of my female friends in any weird way. I'm not an animal who cannot control their lust.</p>
<p><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cqafj-MfB24/Unnr0vFOsQI/AAAAAAAAACY/6nDpwFseRgQ/s1600/avery-wolf-girl.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;She must be manly- like rough and tough!&quot; No, I'm not masculine. I can dress up tom-boyish but I can also dress up as girly as possible- and I don't mind. I like putting on make-up; I even know the right color combinations for eye shadows. I'm quite comfortable being a girl.</p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;She's mentally sick. She needs to see a doctor.&quot; My parents thought the same thing when I tried to come out to them as a teenager. I was dragged to three psychiatrists who had me on meds for a few months. And it did nothing to turn me straight. Because homosexuality is not a mental disorder. It has lost its &quot;status&quot; in 1960s; still, the psychiatrists here continue to treat it as one. Talk about being slow pokes!</p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;She must have been sexually abused as a child and now she can trust no man. Tsk tsk.&quot; No, I did not &quot;become&quot; a lesbian because of that. I have had a minor incident of molestation when I was young- but I was quite gay before that. You can tell you are gay even if you are a kid.</p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;Oh! It's a phase. She will get over it!&quot; Trust me; it's not just a phase. I mean I had my first crush on a girl when I was in Grade 2. One would think if it were a phase, I would have gotten over it by now. And besides, you don't tell a straight girl that being straight is a phase. Then why me?</p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;She must have it easy with girls since they are of the same-sex&quot; No, you couldn't be more wrong.  Being with girls is never easy, even if I'm a girl myself. Being in relationships is hard by itself, and it doesn't change when it comes to same-sex ones. I have had problems too. &quot;What did she mean when she said it?&quot; &quot;Does she want me to say this or should I just keep my mouth shut?&quot; &quot;Does she want me to act jealous or should I just play it cool?&quot; Finding answers to questions like these is never easy.</p>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5m982NVutSQ/Unnszzr64VI/AAAAAAAAACg/SI3qvuT058A/s1600/konoka-and-setsuna.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Some of you are thinking &quot;I wonder who's the guy in her relationships.&quot; No, there's no &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;girl&quot; in the relationship. If I had to be with a guy, I would just be with a guy. If my girlfriend had to be with guy, she wouldn't be with me. Please keep your presumed gender roles away from lesbian relationships. It doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>Some of you horny people are thinking &quot;I wonder if she would join me and my wife in a threesome&quot;. Yeah, I do get that a lot- more than people may think. Not that I would particularly mind being in a threesome- with the right people of course- but just because I'm a lesbian, you can't ask me to join you and your partner in bed. I'm not a sex addict, nor am I dying to take part in your sexual fantasies.</p>
<p>What you think about me does not define the person I'm. If you want to know how I'm as a person, I urge you to come up to me and ask me any weird queries you might have. Stop with stereotyping. Make this world a better and a less complicated place for all of us. Live and let live. Love and let love. Be gay and let be gay.</p>
