<font face="Verdana">This essay with some samples of Quranic contradictions and erroneous science has been prepared to rebut wishful Islamists who are claiming science in Quran. Qur'an has numerous scientific flaws, historical, ethical, and logical contradictions, though Mullahs and many western educated Islamists always claim that Quran is infallible and immutable words of God. To disprove their dishonest and deceitful claim—I have compiled some Quranic contradictions and serious scientific flaws in this essay by using authentic Quranic verses and Sahi hadiths, hence categorically proved that Qur'an was man made book. </font>
<dl><dt><font face="Verdana"><strong>Making up Science</strong> </font></dt></dl><font face="Verdana">All wishful apologists usually take selective (pick &amp; choose) verses, taking part of the verse, sometimes by changing the actual words, adding non-existing words etc, they intentionally twist or manipulate the commonly accepted meanings of verses—to prove science in Quran. As usual, these wishful Mullahs do search for the different meanings of the Arabic words and take the meaning which comes close to their justification, even though, actual sentence construction did not relate that chosen meaning/word at all. Maurice Bucailee and Prof. Keith Moore did exactly what I have just described above. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>Translation and interpretation Problems</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Mullahs and most blind defenders of Quran usually blame the translation of Quran from original Arabic. They will say, translator distorted the verse/verses which was correct in it's original Arabic etc. And they will insist that, certain verse or verses are only understood by Allah Himself, and human being have limited knowledge, so they should not understand Allah's mystery (Qudroot). And they will insist that Quran should be read with the help of Tafsirs (interpretations) by famous Islamic scholars. But, interestingly Allah told the different things in Quran. Allah asked Muslims to believe Quran's literal meaning and clearly forbade any interpretations of Allah's eternal divine words. Quranic verse: 3:7—clearly prohibited to accept anybody's interpretation of Allah's eternal words. Please read this verse below: </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">[Quran-3:7] "He it is Who has revealed the Book to you; some of its verses are clear and decisive, they are the basis of the Book, and others are allegorical; then as for those in whose hearts there is perversity they follow the part of it which is allegorical, seeking to mislead and seeking to give it (their own) interpretation. but none knows its interpretation except Allah, and those who are firmly rooted in knowledge say: We believe in it, it is all from our Lord; and none do mind except those having understanding."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Allah says in Quran that, "I made Qur'an very clear, simple and easy and written in Arabic (44:58, 54:22, 54:32, 54:40) so that Muslims (Arabs of course) can understand very easily?" Please listen what Merciful Allah says in Qur'an: " But We have indeed made the Qur'an easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition? (54:22); and "We have made it a Qur'an in Arabic, that ye may be able to understand and learn wisdom (43:3)". Allah emphatically declared that He made Quran very easy so that Muslims can understand very easily.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">No where in the Quran Allah says that my words must be read with the help of Quranic interpretations and commentaries! Quranic Interpretations and Tafsirs have been invented by some wishful educated Mullahs only to hide Quranic absurdities and contradictions. In fact, Quranic verses are mostly simple to understand and any elementary student can understand very easily. Therefore, claiming that Quran is difficult to understand is ludicrous and lame excuse only to hide Allah's myriads of inanities and flaws.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Below, I have produced some actual and internationally accepted translated Quranic verses (without any change by me) to prove that, Quran do not have any scientific theory as some apologists claim. Rather, Qur'an contains many historical, ethical, logical contradictions and myriads of scientific flaws.</font></p>
<p class="SmallText"><font face="Verdana">[<strong>Special note:</strong> Quranic ayats were taken from Maulana A. Yousuf Ali's English translations of Holy Quran. Maulan Yousuf Ali's translations are internationally accepted as authentic &amp; unbiased. Some of the recent Quranic translation has biased interpretations and word changing (pick &amp; choose) to match with the utopia of science in Quran. Readers may be informed that, the Quranic translation by Maulana A. Yousuf Ali is considered most reliable &amp; Authentic by most Islamic Scholars throughout the world. Hadiths were taken from Bukhari Sharif (Sahih).]</font></p>
<p class="SmallText"><font face="Verdana">
<strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">A. Some Cosmological Flaws: (Scientific contradictions)</span></strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">(1) <em>God created the Heaven first or, the Earth first (?)</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Which one was created first? As you will see in the verses below, Allah at one time says that Earth was created first and another time He says that the Heaven was created first. </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">[Quran-2:29]: It is He who hath created for you all things that are on Earth; THEN He turned to the Heaven and made them into seven firmaments (Skies)…. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">[Quran- 79:27-30]: Are you the harder to create, or is the heaven that He built ? He raised the height thereof and ordered it; and He has made dark the night thereof, and He brought forth the morning thereof. And after that, He spread (flattened) the earth.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Now, does it match modern science? Do you believe that, Earth was created first, and after that, God created Heaven? Does modern science tell us that?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">(2) <em>Numerical contradictions </em></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">There are many numerical contradictions in the Quran. God cannot make an error in doing simple calculations.
How many days did it take to create Heavens and Earth? </font></p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">Your guardian-Lord is Allah who created the heavens and earth in Six Days [Quran 7:54] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">Verily your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and earth in Six Days [Quran 10:3] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">He it is Who created the heavens and earth in Six Days [Quran 11:7] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">He Who created the heavens and earth and all that is between, in Six Days [Quran 25:59] </font></p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">The above verses clearly state that God (Allah) created the heaven and the Earth in 6 days. But the verses below stated: </font>
<blockquote>
<ol>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">Is it that ye deny Him who created the earth in Two Days ? [Quran-41:9] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">He set on the (earth) Mountains standing firm high above it, and bestowed blessing on the earth, and measured therein all things to give them nourishment in due proportion, in FOUR DAYS… [(Quran- 41:10] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">So He completed them (heavens) as seven firmaments in Two days and… [Quran-41:12] </font></p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<font face="Verdana"><strong><em>Now do the math</em></strong>: 2 (for earth) + 4 (for nourishment) + 2 (for heavens) = 8 days; and not 6 days.</font>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>Inheritance laws of Allah</strong> [verses: 4:11-12 and 4:176]</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Quran 4:11-12 and 4:176 state the Qur'anic inheritance law. When a man dies, and is leaving behind three daughters, his two parents and his wife, they will receive the respective shares of 2/3 for the 3 daughters together, 1/3 for the parents together [both according to verse 4:11] and 1/8 for the wife [4:12] which adds up to more than the available estate. A second example: A man leaves only his mother, his wife and two sisters, then they receive 1/3 [mother, 4:11], 1/4 [wife, 4:12] and 2/3 [the two sisters, 4:176], which again adds up to 15/12 of the available property. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In these verses above one can see the total property after adding all distributed parties adds up more than the available property, i.e., totals become more than 1 which are: 1.125 and 1.25. How come? A gross mathematical errors, is not it? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Let us examine Allah's mathematical genius once more in different fashion: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Man dies leaving behind
Wife is1/8 = 3/24 (4:12)
Daughters 2/3 = 16/24 (4:176)
Father 1/6 = 4/24 (4:11)
Mother1/6 = 4/24(4:11)
Total = 27/24=1.125 </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Woman dies leaving no descendants or ascendants
Husband, (1/2) = 1/2 (4:12)
Brother (everything) = 2/2(4:176)
Total = 3/2 =1.5 </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Woman dies leaving no ascendants or descendants and no brother
Husband, (1/2) = 3/6 (4:12, 4:176)
Sister (1/2) = 3/6 (4:11)
Mother (1/3) = 2/6 (4:11)
Total = 8/6 =1.33 </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Man dies leaving behind:
Wife1/4 = 3/12 (4:12)
Mother 1/3 = 4/12 (4:11)
Sisters 2/3 = 8/12 ((4:176)
Total = 15/12 =1.25 </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Adding all distributed properties add up more than the available property, i.e., total becomes more than 1 which are: 1.125, 1.5, 1.33, and 1.25 respectively. Surely, Allah's mathematics was really divine!!!</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>Allah's Days Equal to 1000 Years or 50,000 Years (?)</strong></font>
<ul>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">Verily a day in the sight of the Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning. [Quran 22:47] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">To Him, on a Day, the space whereof will be a thousands years of your reckoning [Quran 32:5] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">The angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a day the measure whereof is Fifty thousands years. So, which one is it ? Is the day of Allah equal to 1,000 earth years or 50,000 earth years? [Quran-70:4] </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(3) Fallacies on Sun-set and Sun-rise (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">The Koran teaches us that the Sun sets in a muddy spring</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"Till, when he (the traveller Zul-qarnain) reached the setting-place of the Sun, he found it going down into a muddy spring…" [Quran-18:86]</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Till, when he reached the rising-place of the Sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had appointed no shelter from it.&quot; [Quran- 18:90]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">There are serious scientific errors here. Firstly, it is scientifically accepted fact that, the Sun never goes down in a muddy spring or clear spring. Secondly, this seems to presuppose a FLAT Earth, otherwise how can there be an extreme point in the West or in the East? A sunrise there would be basically just the same as at any other place on this earth, at land or sea. It would still look as if it is setting &quot;far away&quot;. It does say, that he reached THE PLACE where the Sun sets and in his second Journey the place where it rises. Does any body need to go near rising or setting places to observe—sun-set or sun-rising?</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(4) A resting place for Sun: (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Interestingly, wishful Mullahs claim that this resting place means the ultimate destruction of the Sun. Sorry, brothers you are dead wrong. Look what Quran says in the following Ayats: </font></p>
<ol>
	<li><font face="Verdana">And the sun runneth on his course for a period determined for him; that is the decree of (Him). That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise. [Quran-36:38] </font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shriveled palm leaf. [Quran-36:39] </font></li>
	<li><font face="Verdana">"It is not for Sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit." (This they clearly meant for the Sun and Moon only).  [Quran-36:40] </font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Verdana">Maulana Yousuf Ali's Tafsir:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"The Arabic word "Mustaqarr" may mean (1) a limit of time, a period determined or (2) a resting place or quiescence; (3) a dwelling place. I think, the first meaning (a time period determined) is best applicable here. But some commentators take the second (a resting place). In that case, the simile would be that of the SUN running a race while he is visible to us, and taking a rest during the night to prepare himself to renew his race the following day. His (SUN) stay with the antipodes appears to us as his period of rest.(page:1178, Sura-36,by Yousuf Ali)"</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">In the Ayat above (36:39), Quran tells us that, moon gradually changes its shape and eventually (till she return like an old shriveled palm leaf) becomes very thin (wear off Moon) like dried date leaf (crescent- shaped). Only Mullahs can tell us how much sciences are in this Ayat!</font>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(5) A resting place for sun WAS CONFIRMED BY SAHI HADITHS</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Sahih Bukhari Hadiths:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">Abzur Ghifari (ra) narrated: one day Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) asked me, "Abzar do you know after setting where Sun goes?" I replied, I do not know, only Allah's apostle can say better. Then Prophet (SA) replied, "After setting, the sun remains prostrated under Allah's Aro'sh (Allah's throne) and waits for Allah's command for rising again in the East. Day will come when sun will not get any more permission from Allah to rise again and Qeyamot (dooms day) will fall upon earth."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Please see page # 1133 of Bengali Translated Quran by Maulana Muhiuddin Khan to see this Hadiths for yourself. You can find this Hadith in Sahih Bukhari Sharif. The Saudi King selected Maulana Muhiuddin to Translate Quran and millions of translated Quran have been distributed throughout the whole world. And 100% of all Bangladeshi Mullahs/Karis/Hafezes believe them by their heart.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Can anybody tell me what is it? Can any Islam loving Brother tell us what is it? Does it tell us about the destroyed Sun after 15 Billions years later? Answer is a big NO! Fact is, it was the superstitious belief of ancient people reflected in the Quran and Hadiths by Allah. A 10 year old boy would not tell such fairy tale story today.</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(6) Quran wonders why/how Sun and Moon do not collide/catch each other (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Above Quranic Ayat (36:40) is telling us that---Sun can not catch/overtake/collide with Moon; Or, Night can not oustrip the day, Or, darkness of Night is covered by Day light; and Day light is covered by Darkness of Night. By any means, Allah did not try to tell us about the SHAPE OF THE EARTH as some apologists want us to believe. This will be a ridiculous thinking. Allah actually wanted to tell us that, Night's darkness is covered by Day-light and vice-versa. This observation does not take a divinity to determine. Any human being can see it clearly, even cave people observed it millions of years ago. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Quran told us lots of sciences here. Where is the sun and where is the moon situated? Can anybody tell me how they could collide/meet/overtake each other? Are the sun and moon neighbors to each other? If I walk in the streets of Dhaka, Bangladesh and my brother walks in the streets of Los Angeles, USA, shall we overtake/collide/catch each other? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Allah is indeed a great scientist. I have the answer for this error: Ancient people saw (bare eye observations) Sun and Moon traveling from east to west (and west to east) seemingly in the same Sky area or same path, yet they do not collide or catch each other and causing day and night etc. People in the 7th century hardly could imagine that all of these phenomena are simply due to Earth's rotation and NOT by Sun's rotation. Sun is stationary for Earth, because earth is stuck in the sun's Gravity, like we are stuck in earth' gravity. Quran never say any where in the whole Quran that, THE EARTH ROTATES. Quran maintained Geo-centric theory in every respect. Earth was considered center of the Universe. Perhaps Allah could not feel Earth's rotation, because like humans Allah was also stuck with earth's gravity. This Quranic verse below once more confirms that the EARTH is fixed and never moves. </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">Verily! Allâh grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Truly, He is Ever Most Forbearing, Oft¬Forgiving. [Q 35:41]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Allah thought earth is fixed at the center of the universe and never moves. Allah never could feel that this tiny earth is rotating (moving) constantly around the sun! He also thought that there is something calls sky (like roof over the earth) which also never moves because Mighty Allah is holding it fixed with His Mighty hand! What a ludicrous thinking by Allah!</font>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(7) Why Allah created Stars (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Quran gives us more scientific knowledge by telling us that the stars were created by Allah as missiles to throw at the devils:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">Quran-67:5: And We have (from of old) adorned the lowest heaven (sky) with lamps, and We have made such (Lamps as) missiles to drive away Satans (Evils)… </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Quran-37:6-8: We have indeed decorated the lower heaven (sky) with (in) the stars, (for beauty) and for guard against all obstinate rebellious Satans. So they should not strain their ears in the direction of the Exalted Assembly but be cast away from every side. </font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Thus, the stars are nothing but missiles to throw at devils so that they may not eavesdrop on the heavenly council. Heavenly council? Here Quran is actually talking/describing about falling (shooting) stars (Ulka, Dhumkathoo). Superstitious minds of Quran believed that the sky is the roof (seven firmaments) over the earth where kingdom of Allah situated and there in Allah's kingdom daily assembly (Allah and His Angels) sits to discuss how to run Allah's business on earth. So, Allah does not want Satan to listen Allah's secret conversation with His Angels (readers please see page-1191of Maulan Yousuf ali's Shanrnazul#. 4037-4038 for more interesting story about this). DOES THIS AGREE WITH MODERN SCIENCE?</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(8) Seven heavens (seven firmaments (?)</strong></font>
<ul>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">He who created the seven heavens, one above the other….And We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps… [Quran-67:3-5] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens one above the other, and made the moon a light in their midst, and made the Sun as a lamp. [Quran-71: 15-16] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">And He completed the seven firmaments (heavens) in two days and assigned to each heaven its command; and We adorned the lower heaven with lamps (Sun), and rendered it guarded… [Quran- 41:12] </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana">Quran teaches us that there are seven heavens one above the other (in layered; there are many sahi hadiths in support of this superstitious belief) and that the stars are in the lower heaven, but the moon is in the midst of the seven heavens. How come moon is furthest object than stars? How come SEVEN firmaments (layers)? Modern science tells us that, actually there is no such thing Sky or any roof over us, it is only a space with no known boundary at all. These verses simply reinforce the ancient idea of ROOF over us which is called SKY, is not it? We know very well the word CANOPY stands for a tent in the desert, and Canopy always must have a roof over it to protect from Sun's heat. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">My humble questions to the readers, please tell me how come Allah is telling us that He decorated lower heaven (Sky) by stars? Are stars situated at the lower sky? Modern science tells us that, stars are (most) furthest object from our solar system. Sun is the nearest star for us. Does Quran tell us that the SUN is also a star? Answer is a BIG NO. Allah says Sun is a lamp/torch for the earth. Am I right? Do you see how much science here?</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(9) Sky/Heaven is hanging without pillars and Mountains are placed to prevent shaking (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">The Quran says [31:10]:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">He hath created the heavens (Skies) without supports (pillars) that ye can see, and hath cast into the earth firm Mountains/Hills, so that it quake not with you; and He hath dispersed…..</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Modern science tells us- whole thing around the earth is space and there is no boundary even we go Billions of Trillions of miles in all direction. Questions are: When there is no sky above us then how in the world, question of pillars comes? What was the need of pillars? Do we really have a roof above us? Is there anything called above or bellow in true sense? Are mountains there to prevent earth from shaking? Readers can read a Sahi Bukhari Hadiths about Ascension of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) to heaven (Miraz story) where these seven skies (seven firmaments) have been well recognized and described.</font>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(10) Why Mountains were created (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">In the following verses, Quran claims that mountains were set on the earth so that the earth never can shake when human being dwelt in it. </font></p>
<blockquote>

<font face="Verdana">It is clearly understood that Quranic author was completely ignorant about the geological reasoning for existence of mountains. He saw that mountains are huge and heavy. So, He (Allah) thought mountains actually prevent Shaking (Earthquake) of the earth. Fact is, this particular reason for existence of mountains is a direct contradiction with modern geological knowledge. Geology proves to us that movement of tectonic plates, or earthquake itself causes mountains to be formed. Besides, we know very well that, every year several dozens of earthquakes happen on earth. Then what is the result of Allah's promise? Can we believe that, Mountains are there to prevent earthquake?</font>

<strong>(11) Sun and moon rotates/travels (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Quran never said everything in the universe does move/rotates, but Quran always said SUN and MOON moves/travels. Quran never ever said that, the earth moves or travels. And this is an open challenge to all Mullahs to disprove my assertion. Like all other religious books, Holy Quran believed Geo-centric theory and earth was considered center of the Universe. Only recently, no more than two decades ago, scientists learned that Sun also moves through the galaxy taking all the Planets with it. Fact is Allah was not stating real Sun's movement, (which is, just one circle of Solar galaxy by 226 millions of years) but He (God) was stating Sun's daily movement which was believed for millions of years until Copernicans time. Allah's assertion of &quot;settled place&quot; or &quot;an appointed time&quot; was about the daily Sun rise and Sun setting. Following verses will prove that very clearly: </font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">"He created the heavens and the earth (in true proportions) ; He makes the Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night; He has subjected The Sun and Moon (to his law); each one follows a course for a time appointed." Here each one clearly refers to Sun &amp; Moon (in the previous sentence), and not everything in the Universe as wishful apologists claim. [Quran-39:5] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">"Seest thou not that Allah merges Night into Day and He merges Day into Night; That He has subjected the sun and moon (to His law), each running its course for a term (time) appointed." [Quran-31:29] </font></p>
</li>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">"It is He who created The Night and Day, And the Sun and Moon; each of them Swim (float) along in its own course." [Quran-21: 33] </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana">Ayats mentioned above could be found over and over, again and again almost in every other pages of Quran. Because, Quranic author, standing in the open Arab desert saw very well that, every morning SUN is rising from the East and gradually (appointed time or fixed time) setting to the West, and as a result, day and night follows. Allah truly mentioned this wrong knowledge (sun moving) of pre-historic people. Every time Allah mentioned sun &amp; moon, He mentioned day &amp; night, as if, it is due to sun's movement day and night follows. Allah also saw, both the sun and moon are traveling seemingly at the same sky area and He was amazed how come they do not collide or how come sun can not catch moon(?) That was the sun's movement Allah was talking about, which cave people could have said millions of years ago or a boy of five can say that very accurately. Is not it? Who does not see Sun's movement from east to west?
 </font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>Truth about Sun's movement </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Although, modern science believes that Sun also moves, Sun is considered stationary for earth in real/practical sense, because earth is stuck to the giant gravitation of the sun and continuously moves along with the sun wherever it goes, just the way we are stuck to earth's gravity and do not feel earth's movement at all. Yet science (people, not Allah) discovered that sun also moves, but what is the sun's course? In real world, Sun takes about 226 million years to make just one complete circle through the Solar galaxy. And this movement of sun has nothing to do with DAY &amp; NIGHT of the earth. Then, why Allah was telling almost in every pages of Quran: &quot; I compelled sun and moon to travel for fixed/appointed times (supposedly 12 hours daily) and day and night follows&quot; Why? There was no valid reason why Allah would say again and again about the Sun's final stage destruction (?) of &quot;white dwarf&quot;, as some unscrupulous Mullahs claimed. Could any body tell me exactly what relation does it (sun's movement) have with day and night? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In Quran, Allah always tells about Day &amp; Night whenever He says about sun &amp; moon? What is the relation of movements of sun and moon with day and night? Is day and night follows because of sun's movement? One certainly needs to wonder, why Allah has to mention hundreds of times, about sun's 226 millions year journey (as some wishful apologists claim that) to tell about day and night? What relation sun's movement has with the day and night? It is obvious that, Allah was telling sun's daily movement from east to west which people believed for millions of years. But surprisingly, all the wishful apologists giving false credit to Allah by saying: look Quran told about sun's movement 1400 years ago which modern science only found out now. These apologists asking us to believe that Allah actually mentioned Sun's orbit of the Solar Universe. What a wishful distortion of the truth. In fact, Quran repeatedly mentioned about the following only: Sun, Moon, Stars, heavens (Sky) and earth. That's all. Quran never mentioned even about other planets (Jupiter, Mars, Pluto etc.) Quran portrayed all those Planets as nearest stars. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Readers Please consider the following: (a) Sahi hadiths I gave about Sun's rest under Allah's Aroosh? (b) What relation day and night might have with the Sun's single movement by 226 millions of years? (c) If Quran already has established Helio-centric cosmology (as some wishful Islamists claim) then why Arabic Mullahs did not come forward to save Copernicas, Leonardo Bruno, Galileo etc. from those Christian Mullahs?</font></p>

<strong>(12) Sky/Heaven is nothing but A ROOF or Canopy over the Earth (?)</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">The Quran says:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">And We have made the sky a roof withheld (from them). Yet they turn away from its portents. [Quran-21:32 </font></p>

</li>
</ul>
<font face="Verdana">Modern science tells us- whole thing around the earth is space and there is no boundary even we go Billions of Trillions of miles in all direction. Questions are: When there is no sky above us then how in the world, question of pillars comes? Do we really have a roof above us? Is there a canopy (Shamiaa'na) above the earth? In most Bengali translated Quran all Maulanas writes: Allah <em>akashke samiaana bannei-ese</em>. Is there anything called above or below in true sense? This verse below even confirming the idea of 'Canopy' which has no holes/windows and it is like a sealed cap over the earth which is a "couch" for mankind. </font>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>(13) Allah foretold in the Quran that mankind will conquer space!</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Source of this Islamic science is the verse below: </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">O ye assembly of Jinns and men! If it be Ye can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, pass ye! Not without authority shall ye be able to pass! [Q 55:33]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">On several previous Ayats (preceding to this verse above) were full of cautions &amp; threats to the unbelievers. Allah was cautioning that soon judgment day will come and nobody will be able to flee from the accountability of their misdeeds. Therefore, by this particular Ayat Allah actually challenging all unbelieving "Jins &amp; Men" that nobody can escape death or judgment of Allah and nobody can escape from the boundary of Sky (heaven) and earth, the CANOPY OF ALLAH (readers please see page#1320 of Bengali translated Qur'an by Saudi King. You will be amazed how apologists have distorted/manipulated the actual notion of this Ayat). Here Allah is challenging Jins and Men that they can never go out of this boundary of earth &amp; Sky ("beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth") without a special authority/power from god, which Jins and men do not possess. Literally, Allah proclaimed that Jins &amp; men can not pierce the wall of this Allah's Canopy. But, apologists are claiming that Allah actually told that, men can (?) conquer the space. Apologists virtually reversed the actual notion of this Ayat to claim that Quran foretold mankind's conquest of space. What a wishful distortion of the Quranic verse by Islamists to gain science in Quran?

<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>(14) Once again Allah considered sky as roof over the earth which will break/shatter on the dooms day (?)</strong></font></p>

<font face="Verdana">Yousuf Ali comments in his Tafsir: beautiful blue sky overhead (which we take for granted in sunshine) will be shattered to pieces. Modern science tells us that there is no such thing as roof/sky or any canopy over the earth, rather all around earth is a limitless space. Only Allah knows what will break/shattered or will get soft/flimsy or how doors will open , there is no walls, where from doors will come? In some Ayats (Quranic verses) Allah threatened kafirs by saying: "I (Allah) will throw broken pieces of sky over your head." </font>

<strong>(15) Quran foretold about cosmic expansion of Big-bang theory! </strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Allah says:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">And We have spread out the (spacious) earth: How excellently We do spread out! [Quran-51:48]</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;With the power and skill did we construct the Firmament; for it is We Who create the vastness of space.&quot; [Quran-51:47]</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Have We not made the earth as a wide expanse, And the mountains as pegs (anchor)? [Quran-78: 6-7]</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">And the earth We have spread out (like a carpet); set thereon Mountains firm and immovable; [Quran-15:19]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana"><em>Shune-nozul</em> (<em>Tafsir</em>) by Maulana Yousuf Ali:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"The space in heavens above, Who can comprehend it but He Who made it sustains it. The globe of the earth under your feet, how great its expanse seems over sea and land, and spread out for you like a wonderful carpet or bed of rest." </font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Now, does this match with space expansion of our universe according to the Big-bang theory? Certainly not. Quran never told that "Universe" is expanding; rather Allah talked about the unlimited open space between the Earth and the imaginary sky. And Allah also bragged that He made the earth wide and spacious. Allah was sure that earth is flat like a carpet and mountains are there to anchor the earth so that earth does not shake with us. Is there any modern science here? APOLOGISTS TRIED TO EXPLAIN THESE WORDS "EXPANSE" OR "SPEAD OUT" AS THE COSMIC EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE. This is a pure distortion of the actual intention of the Ayat.
<p> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>(16) Big-Bang theory foretold in Quran! </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Islamists by their ultra-wishful interpretations of the Quranic verse: 21:30 shamelessly and foolishly try to fool the gullible poor Muslims and some westerners that Holy Quran already told about Big-bang theory 1400 hundred years ago! Source of their weird claim is the verse below:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" [Quran-21:30, Yousuf Ali]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">What Koran said was very simple. Earth and sky (heaven-a roof over head?) was separated by Allah and Allah is trying to take this credit! That means, Earth and Sky was already there and Allah by his mighty hands separated them? Which idiotic scientist has ever told this nonsense about Big-bang? Does the Big-bang theory really tells that, that earth and sky were already here and these two were just separated and some mad guys call it Big bang theory? This Bedouin Allah thought the so called Sky is a roof or canopy over the flat earth. Who does not know in the 21st century that the so called sky is nothing but space which has no boundary or limit? Actually, there is no such thing called sky; although, people still call it sky by sheer habit developed out of ignorance since ancient time. Question is, do we have any sky over our head? Answer is a Big No! </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Folklores of separating Sky (a solid roof) from the flat earth existed in Arabia! Let us examine this verse below: </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"Allah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see; is firmly established on the throne (of authority); He has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law)! Each one runs (its course) for a term appointed. He doth regulate all affairs, explaining the signs in detail, that ye may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Lord." [Quran-13:2, Yousuf Ali]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">This verse above clearly depicted the existence of superstitious belief about Earth and sky in ancient Egypt. And very clearly (wrong perceptions of course) described how Allah appointed Sun and Moon to rotate over the fixed earth to cause day and night. In fact, the idea of this above Quranic verses was originated from superstitions commonly believed by Pagans in the Middle East. Such childish or simplistic idea that the heavens and earth were once joined and then separated by the activity of Gods and Goddesses was actually derived from the ancient belief that sky they saw above their heads is a solid roof (Quran repeatedly called it roof or canopy) which mighty Allah separated by His mighty hands and hanged above without any pillars. Among the Egyptians for example, it was the involuntary separation of Geb (the Earth god) from his wife and sister Nut (the sky goddess) that was responsible for the division of the earth from the sky. The Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh likewise describes the moment "when the heavens had been separated from the earth, when the earth had been delimited from the heavens" as a result of the separation of a sky God (An) from an earth Goddess (Ki) [THHuxley]. We can easily find the root of this above verse (13:2) made up by Allah of the Quran. Question is do we get any science in this superstitious rubbish?</font>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>What is Big-bang theory?</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">The Big Bang is the cosmological model of the universe that is best supported by all lines of scientific evidence and observation. The essential idea is that the universe has expanded from a primordial hot and dense initial condition at some finite time in the past and continues to expand to this day [Wikepedia]. Moreover, Big Bang in Physics refers to the explosion of SPACE-TIME SINGULARITY (not matter). Matter was not even created when Big Bang happened approximately 15 Billion years ago. Earth was formed billions of years after the Big Bang by sheer cosmic evolutionary process. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">By any means, Big bang theory has been just speculated by the scientists and is accepted by the majority of the scientists, and it is yet to be proven. What happens if in the future scientists come up with different theory of creation and discard this Big-bang theory altogether? What the hell these poor Islamists will do then? Truth is Quran never spoken anything that at all fits with the hypothetical discovery of Big-Bang theory discovered by modern science. Quranic perception of parting sky from the earth was purely based on ancient superstitious belief about our mysterious universe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>(17) The Universe is only 4,137 years old!</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">If we believe Quranic creation theory, or Biblical genealogy then, the age of this whole universe is less than five thousands year old. Islamic scriptures say that Allah has created this heaven and earth, from nothingness, within six days and after that He created Adam, the first human being; and Prophet Muhammad was the 90th descendant of Adam. According to calculation, considering 30 years to be the age difference between two successive generations, Allah created this heaven and earth only 4,137 years ago. On the contrary, geological experts say that the earth is more than 4.5 billion years old. Question is who is right about it? Allah was right or the modern scientists are right?</font></p>

<strong>B. Some Embryological contradictions/errors</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Man is Created From Clotted blood(?)</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">Then fashioned We the drop (semen) a CLOT OF CONGEALED BLOOD then fashioned We the clot a little lump (fetus), fashioned We the little lump into bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then produced it another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators. [Quran-23:14]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">(Bengali translations of the Quran read: "<em>Zamaa't Raokto theeke Manoosh banieesi</em>" And this Ayat has been repeated again and again throughout the Quran)</font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">• Then he becomes a CLOT; then (Allah) shaped and fashioned… [Quran-75:38]</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">• Created man, out of a mere clot of congealed blood [Quran-96:2]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">There are serious scientific problems here.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A blood clot can not grow into anything. This idea came from the Greeks. Aristotle erroneously believed that humans are originated from the action of male semen upon female menstrual blood, which is absolutely an incorrect assumption. The Quran's assertion on the clot (<em>alaqa</em>) is completely wrong about human development, since there is absolutely no stage during which the embryo consists of a clot. The only situation in which an embryo might appear like a clot is during a miscarriage, in which case the clotted blood which is seen to emerge (much of which comes from the mother) is solidified and by definition no longer alive. Therefore, if ever an embryo appeared to look like a clot it would never develop any further into a human; it would be a dead mass of bloody miscarriage. Since Prophet Muhammad had some thirteen wives it is entirely possible that he would be very familiar with miscarriages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Modern science tells us that the formation of human embryo is a seamless continuation from conception to the birth; hence there are no hard-and-fast boundaries of stages as the Quran described. The Quran described 4 stages which match exactly with Galenic description of the development of the human embryo (which was proved wrong by modern science). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Creation of bones and clothing of bones with flesh: According to modern embryologists including Prof. Moore of Canada, the tissue from which bone originates, known as mesoderm, is the same tissue as that from which muscle (flesh) develops. Thus bone and muscles begin to develop simultaneously, rather than sequentially (as the Quran tells us). Moreover, most of the muscle tissue that we human have is laid down before birth, but bones continue to develop and calcify (strengthen with calcium) right into one's teenage years. So it would be more accurate if the Quran had said that muscles started to develop at the same time as bones, but completed their development earlier. The idea that bones are clothed with flesh is not only scientifically completely wrong/false, but was directly copied from the ancient Greek doctor Galen's hypothesis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Also, the idea of saying: &quot;made into bones and clothed the bones with muscle&quot; came from the technique of making animal statues (<em>Moorthy</em>) out of rod and cement or mud. People usually make the skeleton (out of rod or stick) first and, then cover it up with cement or mud. This is scarcely a scientific description of embryonic development. It is rather a description of a layman. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Actually, what is very interesting about Quranic so called science are: Qur'anic scientific verses matches with Aristotle and Galenic theories of Embryology and Ptolemic Geo-centric theory of Astronomy which were prevailing almost thousand years before the arrival of qur'an. HOWEVER, ALL THESE THEORIES WERE PROVEN MOSTLY WRONG BY MODERN SCIENCE. </font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>Quran foretold life from WATER</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Let us find out from what Quran predicted origin of life from water. The Hindu scripture <em>Veda</em> (8000 B.C.) described origin of Earth and life from WATER of the SEA. The Great Greek Philosopher and Scientist THALES (640-546 B.C.) was the first Human to theorize that, Everything in this Universe was created from WATER OF THE SEA. Problem was, Thales could not provide any scientific proof. After that, ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C.), the pupil of Plato and Tutor of Alexander the Great, concluded: &quot;Because of the fact that, Plants &amp; Animal body contains plenty of WATER and life needs WATER that was why THALES thought WATER WAS THE ORIGIN OF LIFE&quot;. Therefore, Mankind did not have to wait until 7th century for Allah to say importance of WATER for life.</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>HONEY as the medicine</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Wish full Islamists demand that Quran predicted Honey as the good medicine. Honey although it is not a great medicine by today's context, was used by Ancient people as medicine and food for tens of thousands of years. Physicians of Pharaohs, the Kings pf Egypt, used to prescribe Honey for diseases. In pre-Islamic Arab, PAGANS widely used HONEY as medicine. In India, Ayurbedic medicine widely used HONEY as the ingredients of medicine thousands of years before the arrival of Qur'an. Honey was known as <em>'Grandma's Medicine'</em> throughout the Ancient World for thousands of years.</font></p>
<font face="Verdana">
<strong>EVOLUTION VS. RELIGIOUS CREATION THEORY</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Some Islamists often try to ridicule the theory of evolution in order to protect the obvious fallacies of the creation theory of religion. Most Islamists and orthodox religionists of other religions try to discard evolution theory. Interestingly, however, some of them also make futile attempts to explain the compatibility of religious creation theory with the theory of evolution! This is, of course, a hypocrisy; and a totally impossible and weird dream by those Islamists.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">EVOLUTION is the greatest triumphs of human discovery. Evolution is not a peripheral subject but the central organizing principle of all biological sciences today. So no one ignorant of evolution can understand science. Secondly, evolution is as well documented as any phenomenon in science, as strongly as the Earth's revolution around the sun rather than vice versa. Therefore, we can call evolution a &quot;Fact&quot;. Today's biological sciences are directly propagating on the basis of evolution theory of Darwin.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">For the last 100 years or so, the galloping advancement of science, particularly the life science, is purely on the basis of Darwin THEORY OF EVOLUTION and definitely not on the basis of CREATION THEORY. Science does not believe in CREATION theory and Religion does not believe in EVOLUTION theory. Truth is, if Religion wants to mix-up with evolution then, we shall have to consider Adam as Ape-like Neanderthal or Homo-erectus early human, and not a perfect human having all the intelligential qualities, as the Bible or Quran described.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Here in this Verse, Allah Challenges People: Who Can Tell Whether the Conceived is Male or Female (?)</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">• Verily the knowledge of the Hour is With God (alone). It is He Who sends down rain, and He who knows what is in the wombs of mothers…. [Quran-31:34]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Who does not believe the fact that, actually mankind can predict very accurately (99.5%) when rain will fall and can predict (99.8%) the sex of the child inside a mother's womb? Scientists also predict that, in the next five years weather predictions will be successfully correct almost 100%. Perhaps Allah could not imagine this.</font>

<strong>C. Historical blunders in Quran</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">In several Suras the Qur'an confuses Mary the mother of Jesus [Miriam in Hebrew] with Miriam the sister of Aaron and Moses, and daughter of Amram which is about 1400 years off. </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"At length she brought (the babe) to her people, carrying him (in her arms), They said: "O Mary! Truly a strange thing has thou brought! "O sister of Aaron, thy father was not a man of evil, nor your mother a woman unchaste!" [Sura:19:27-28]</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">And Mary, the Daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity, and We breathed into (her body) of our spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord, and of His revelations, and was one of the devout (servants). [Sura:66:12]</font></blockquote>

<strong>Allah copied draconian code of law from the ancient king Hammurabi!</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Hammurabi, the King of Babylonia, Mesopotamia (2900 B.C.) gave the low: Killing for revenge, i. e., &quot;life for life, hand for hand, eye for eye, ears for ears, tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">And the Allah's law in Qur'an [5:45] says: &quot;life for life, hand for hand, eye for eye, ear for ear, tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">What is the difference between the code? Don't we see any similarities between the judgment of King Hammurabi (a human), and Omnipotent Allah? Here in this decree of judgment, who probably copied from whom? Was not the Allah (which was Muhammad himself) copied from that Kaffir Hammurabi and sold it in the name of his imaginary Allah?</font></p>

<strong>D. Some samples of utterly unethical verses in Quran </strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><em>(1) Sex with slave girls</em>
 </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"Not so the worshippers, who are steadfast in prayer, who set aside a due portion of their wealth for the beggar and for the deprived, who truly believe in the Day of Reckoning and dread the punishment of their Lord (for none is secure from the punishment of their Lord); who restrain their carnal desire (save with their wives and their slave girls, for these are lawful to them: he that lusts after other than these is a transgressor..." [QURAN - 70:22-30]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">This verse shows that Muslim men were allowed to have sex with their wives (of course) and their slave girls. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">QURAN 23:5-6:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"...who restrain their carnal desires (except with their wives and slave girls, for these are lawful to them..."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Again, Muslim men were allowed to have sexual relations with their wives and slave girls. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">QURAN - 4:24: </font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"And all married women are forbidden unto you save those captives whom your right hand possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. (Muhammad Pickthall's English translation of the Quran). </font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">QURAN - 33:50: </font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"Prophet, We have made lawful to you the wives whom you have granted dowries and the slave girls whom God has given you as booty;..."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">This verse is for Muhammad. Supposedly, God allows Muhammad to have sex with his slave girls. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">The above verses are only a few I have mentioned out of numerous such verses scattered throughout the Quran. What could be more unethical matter than having sex with slave girls? Allah (SBT) graciously allowed Muslims to have sex with slave girls. Prophet Muhammad himself and his disciples routinely used to have sex with their slave girls. Islamic apologists try to make the truth foggy by their wishful excuse that, actually Allah meant to say, &quot;Muslims can have sex with slave girls after marrying them&quot;. Problem is after the slave girl is married by a Muslim man, how in the world Allah or any sane person can still call that wife (slave-wife) as the slave girl? Does a slave girl never change her title even after she is married? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Many erudite Islamic pundits emphatically claim that Allah sent Quran as the super guidance for not only Muslims, but for all mankind. My questions to them are as follows: </font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px"><font face="Verdana">a) Could you tell us in which country on earth this super guidance is followed?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px"><font face="Verdana">b) Could you tell us if you find some man in any civilized country having sex with his slave girl, what will be your conclusion about that guy?</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 6px"><font face="Verdana">c) Should all human kind follow this unethical Quranic guidance to day? </font></p>

(2) <em>Hilla Marriage-A curse, shame, and humiliation for women</em> </font>
<dl><dt><font face="Verdana">So if a husband Divorces his wife (irrevocably), he can not, after that, re-marry her until after she has married another husband and he has divorced her. In that case there is no blame on either of them if they re-unite; provided they feel that they can keep the limits ordained by God [Quran-2:230, Yousuf Ali]. </font></dt></dl><font face="Verdana">Sahi Bukhari: #564:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">Syed ibne ukair..Aisha (ra) narrated that wife of Rifakurzi told to the apostle of God that (because) my husband Rifa has divorced me I married another man named Abdur rahman ibne kurzi but I want to go back to my former husband. Then Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) told—if you want to go back to your former husband you must have sex with Abdur Rahman and then if he divorce you then you can go to your former husband, otherwise it can not happen. </font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">My dear honorable readers how do you like these above Quranic verse and sahi hadith? Are they sounding ethical to at all? After reading the above holy verse#2:230—any elementary student will agree with me that, Qur'an and Hadith strongly and clearly commands for Hilla marriage to purify the divorced wife to be taken back by the former husband. The irony is, how can this Hilla marriage do the purification of an innocent divorced wife? Who is at fault, in the first place, in this scenario of a hasty divorce? Quite obviously it was the husband who had made the mistake. Then, why in the world poor wife has to be punished (sleep with another strange man) for the crime she did not commit? Because, of all merciful Allah said so in the Holy Qur'an, Period. What a compassionate judgment from our Merciful Allah! </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">(3) <em>Adoption in Islam was prohibited by Allah</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Islam prohibits adopting children, Period. Adoption in the technical sense is not allowed in Muslim Shriah law. This is because Allah does not like this gesture of adopting orphan children. So Allah commanded his prophet to marry Zainab Bint Jahsh in order to abolish pagan custom (<em>Fatawa al-Imam</em>).&quot; Al-sabuni states,</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"As to Zainab Bint Jahsh, the Messenger of Allah married for no higher wisdom than to abolish the heresy of adoption (A-sabuni)." </font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">It follows from this revelation that the adopter may marry the ex-wife of his adopted son and vice-versa. </font>
<blockquote><font face="Verdana">"Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but [he is] God's Messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. God is Aware of everything!" [Sura al-Ahzab 33:40]</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;We married her off to you so that there would be no objection for believers in respect to their adopted sons' wives once they have accomplished their purpose with them. God's command must be done!&quot; [Sura al-Ahzab 33:37]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana">Thus Prophet Muhammad married Zainab in order to provide a good example of what the All-wise legislator was seeking to establish by way of rights and privileges for adoption. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In the verse (33:37) there is stated a particular purpose for this revelation and action of Muhammad. It is not for himself, but it is for the future of the Muslim community. It is so that in future there may not be a problem if anybody (father-in-law) wants to marry the divorced wife of an adopted son. &quot;We permitted you to marry her so that it may hence be legitimate and morally blameless for a believer to marry the wife of his adopted son.&quot; It is a mystery why in the world any father-in law will need to marry his adopted son's wife which is extremely unethical. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Pre-Islamic Arab Custom: Adoption of orphan/helpless child was a very popular and moral practice amongst pre-Islamic Arabs. By adopting orphan/helpless child, they used to consider adopted child as their own. And they used to pass onto them the adopter's genealogy and name, his investment of them with all the rights of the legitimate son including that of inheritance and the prohibition of marriage on grounds of consanguinity. I don't know, how in the world Allah could dislike such noble deeds. I am not sure what percentage of Muslims actually knows this divine law. I do admit that I never knew this and, I was stunned when I first learnt this from a real Mullah. How and why was this noble custom among human being prohibited? Only Merciful Allah knows it!

<p><font face="Verdana">E. <strong>Self-contradictory Quranic verses </strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Which one is correct:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">• There is no Compulsion in religion…. [Quran-2:256]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">OR</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">• Fight those who do not profess the true faith (Islam) till they pay  the polltax (jiziya) with the hand of humility. [Quran-9:29]</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">• Then, when the sacred months have passed, slay the idolaters wherever ye find them and take them captive, and besiege them and prepare for them each ambush…. [Quran-9:5]</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">• When you meet the unbelievers in the Jihad strike off their heads…. [Quran-47:4]</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">• And slay (kill) them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out such is the reward of those who suppress faith. [Quran-2:191]</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">• O Apostle! Rouse the believers to the fight…(against) unbelievers. [Quran-8: 65]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px"><font face="Verdana">Very often apologetics claim that, Islam is a religion of peace and there is no compulsion. Yet, punishment of an apostate in Islam is, of course, death penalty.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 7px">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana">F. <strong>Meaningless Recitation of Quranic verses</strong> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana">Millions of devoutly fanatical and gullible Muslims (Arabs and non-Arabs) recite (parroting) Quranic verses at least 5 times daily. Strange thing is non-Arab Muslims do not understand the meaning of a single word at all. Yet, unlike any others, Muslims recite their Quran like '<em>Tantor Montor</em>' or '<em>Abra-ka-dabra</em>' of a magician, or like &quot;Mantro&quot; of a witch hunter. From the very childhood brainwashing, these Muslims were taught that reciting Holy Quran even without understanding any meaning is the best practice of worshipping Allah and can earn unlimited blessings from Allah. Therefore, these Islamic Zombies recite Quranic verses with sweet melodious voice daily, and they will also recite Quranic verses during their daily five time prayers. Even western educated highly qualified devout Muslims have no qualm or shame that they do not really understand what they are reciting from the Qur'an.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Among the Muslim majority nations—there is a special and very prestigious degree awarded by Madrasshas called &quot;<em>Hafez</em>&quot; to religious student who has memorize entire Qur'an, of course, without understanding the meaning of anything. These so called genius '<em>Hafezes</em>' regarded as the best and highly pious Muslims, even though, these Islamic robots hardly understand anything of Quran! Annually, all Muslim nations will stage '<em>Hafez</em>-competition' in which many <em>Hafezes</em> will compete to perform their better recitation (like a well trained and tamed parrot) and best award will be given to the winners of this hilarious competition.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Their superstitious belief in Quran is so strong that some unscrupulous Mullahs even sell Quranic verses as disease-curing medicine in the form of 'bullets' they call it 'Tabiz'. And this practice of Quranic medicine is very much flourishing business in most Muslim majority nations. Because of these erroneous and superstitious belief systems among the Muslims, quack medical practices and bogus Sufi saints (<em>Pir</em>, <em>Fakir</em>, dervish and Allah's agents or religious ascetic or mendicant wonder workers) are prolific &amp; flourishing who by their cunning tactics of deception randomly plunders the hard-earned wealth from those millions of gullible poor and rich Muslims. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Funny thing is, they will recite Quranic verses (while praying) which actually dictate prohibition of some deeds; but they never follow the scriptural dictum and practice the same prohibited deeds anyway. Because they did not get the actual message, since they simply did not understand the meaning of the verse. On the other hand, say, they will recite the verses (with melodious songs) that dictate to kill or cut the neck of non-Muslims but (fortunately) they will not cut the neck of non-Muslims since they did not understand a word of it. Or, the Imam in the Mosque will recite verses that actually describe menstruation (women's monthly physiological period) is illness (?) and prohibition of sexual act during that period. Interestingly, the Imam will do this strange recitation for the Muslim congregation comprised of men and women—and they all will utter &quot;Ameen&quot; in a chorus like some tamed parrots. Such is their blind belief in Islamic Qur'an. </font></p>

<strong>Great source of this utopia of Quranic science!!!</strong></font>
<p><font face="Verdana">The primary source of the sudden utopia of these crazy Islamic science discoveries in Quran was the EUREKA by Maurice Bucaille.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><em>MAURICE BUCAILLE</em> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Who was Maurice Bucaille? Was he a world famous scientist? Or, Was he a Nobel laureate? Or, was he an authority in theology, Embryology, or Astronomical science?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">ANSWER IS NONE OF THE ABOVE.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Maurice Bucaille was an ordinary French Physician and lived in Saudi Arabia as an expatriate doctor to Saudi Royal family. He was not a better doctor than any of those hundreds of Bangladeshi or Indian expatriate Physician working in Saudi Arabia. But because, he was the Physician for Saudi King family he developed a special relation with Saudi King. To keep religious trade (<em>Dharma Bebosha</em>) booming, Saudi king asked him to write a book highlighting Qur'anic sciences for which the King offered him $6 million dollars. Clever French Doctor wrote the book &quot;The Bible, The Quran and Science&quot;, got <span class="math">\(6 millions and got another\)</span> 2 millions by selling his book (according to Dr. Campbell). This book was sold in Islamic World like a hot cake. It was told that, this doctor distorted the actual translation of Holy Qur'an by intentional/selective choosing of various meanings of Arabic words in order to match his theory of scientific explanation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><em>DR. WILLIAM F CAMPBELL</em></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Who is Dr. William F. Campbell?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">William Campbell is an American Physician who was an expatriate doctor for the family of the King of Tunisia for 20 years. After learning about the book of Dr. Bucaille, he wrote a book of 300 pages categorically rebutting Dr. Bucaille's book. I urge readers to read Dr. Campbell's book and see for themselves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The contradictions I have illustrated in this article are only some samples, and of course, not exhaustive of the list. Quran is replete with them. As I mentioned earlier, all most all Quranic verse are self-explanatory. That is, when a verse is read, it gives a certain picture of the situation in which or, a particular circumstance due to which a particular verse was written down. It's language of expression (no matter in which language) is very plain and simple. By reading a Quranic verse—one can easily see the inner-point/meanings, as to why and what actually Islamic Allah wanted to tell. As far I know, earlier translated Qurans (e.g. Maulana Yousuf Ali, Maulana Mahiuddin Khan, Maulana Fazlur Rahman Munshi and many others) were fairly sincere in their work of translation of original Arabic Quran. In those translated Quran, nobody claimed any trace of modern science. Since the &quot;<em>Urekha</em>&quot; created by Maurice Bucaille, our educated mullahs (not real mullahs) started discovering lots of science in Quran. Recently, some real educated Mullahs translated Quran with pick &amp; choose word meanings from original Arabic Quran. They find alternate word meanings and choose the word which matches their intended purpose of explaining modern science. But they forgot that, actual scenario/circumstances of the Ayats do not at all match their wishful explanation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">In Bengali society there is a proverb: <em>&quot;Ka baalte Kalikatta buz'en&quot;</em> (you understand Calcutta when 'C' is uttered). But in this subject of Quranic interpretation, wishful Mullahs make &quot;Ka&quot; not just (only) Kalikatta, they can make Bombay, Madras, Delhi, Karachi, London, New York and what not by 'Ka'. They can make almost anything to make a good match to Allah's saying. And they do not even care whether people can swallow it or not.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Finally, I maintain my assertion that Qur'an possesses many contradictions/scientific flaws, ethical, historical and logical blunders and of course ample inconsistencies and redundancies. Yet, wishful apologists will never see what we can see, because of this great saying mentioned below:</font></p>
