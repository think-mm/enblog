About 475 million years ago the plants were evolving; thereby, populating the ground.<span>  </span>About 400 million years ago, the insects and pre-gymnosperm (ancient seeded plants) made their way into our earth; thus making the world a bit crowded.<span>  </span>About 350-360 million years ago the amphibians started to evolve while 50 million years later, roughly about 300 million years ago, the reptiles were making their way into our earth.<span>  </span></font></font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">The sequencing of DNA became a hot field starting from late 1970s and it is still continuing without any sign of a slowdown.<span>  </span>Many microbes, plants of agronomic value, and animals were targeted for genomics study.<span>  </span>The first microbe whose genes (DNA) were sequences was that of a bacteria by the name <em><span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227289012_14" class="yshortcuts">Escherichia coli</span></em>. Next, on the eukaryotic side the genome of baker's yeast was completely sequenced.<span>  </span>Soon, the fruit fly's genome was sequenced.<span>  </span>Now, the genomes of many species of mammals are being sequenced and the results are being compared for sequence homology and the orderliness of many genes is being studied.</font></font></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">The Australian marsupial kangaroo was targeted by the Australian biologists for the studies of genomics. The government in <span id="lw_1227289012_15" class="yshortcuts">Australia</span> established a center by the name '<span id="lw_1227289012_16" class="yshortcuts">Centre of Excellence</span> for Kangaroo Genomics.'<span>  </span><span id="lw_1227289012_17" class="yshortcuts">The Scientists</span> from the center said they had for the first time mapped the genetic or nucleotide code of the <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227289012_18" class="yshortcuts">Australian marsupials</span> and found much of it was very similar to the genome for humans.</font></font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">Biologists with genomics background had opined that there will be genetic similarities between kangaroo and human for sure but no one ever thought that clusters of genes will be same in these two groups of mammals.<span>  </span>Perhaps during speciation the <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227289012_19" class="yshortcuts">gene clusters</span> were transferred from species to species. <span> </span>Dr. Jenny Graves, the center director of Australian kangaroo research put this finding this way; "We thought they'd be completely scrambled, but they're not. There is great chunks of the <span style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed" id="lw_1227289012_20" class="yshortcuts">human genome</span> which is sitting right there in the kangaroo genome."<span>  </span></font></font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">In my view Dr. Graves should have said that the clusters of Kangaroo genes are sitting right in the human genome because humans have evolved from kangaroos.<span>  </span>Evolutionary biologists think that humans' primitive ancestors have parted from kangaroos about 150 million years ago.<span>  </span>Contrast this, if you may, with that of mice and humans.<span>  </span>Human's ancestors have diverged from mice about 70 million years ago.<span>  </span>The genomes of humans and mice show an astounding 95% plus sequence homology.<span>  </span>Similarly, the chimps show a lot more sequence homology with humans than it is with mice.<span>  </span>Conversely, the fruit fly and human genes show about 60% sequence homology.<span>  </span>These results clearly show that <span id="lw_1227289012_21" class="yshortcuts">Darwin 's theory of evolution</span> is after all correct.<span>  </span>Darwin was a naturalist who studied diversity of traits among animals. This he did at the time when no one knew what a gene is!<span>  </span>In one hundred years or so the field of biology made so much progress that Darwin 's theory is now being applied to molecular biology.<span>  </span>The fusion of evolutionary biology into molecular biology has spawned many new fields of study.<span>    </span><span>  </span></font></font></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><font face="Garamond"><font size="4">On a lighter side, it has not escaped my attention that humans still sport a pair of strong legs just as goats, cattle, kangaroos; consequently, humans could jump.<span>  </span>The basketball players, soccer player etc., are adept in jumping; therefore, the genes controlling the muscle strength of legs in humans must have originated from kangaroo or the species that is the ancestor of Australian jumping marsupials.<span>  </span>Try telling all these to a person who thinks that the biblical account of genesis is true.<span>  </span>You surely will get a strange response.<span>   </span><span> </span><span> </span></font></font></span></p>
