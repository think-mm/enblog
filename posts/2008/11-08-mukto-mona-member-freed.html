<p><strong>A prominent critic of the Malaysian government, blogger Raja Petra Kamaruddin, has been freed from jail on the orders of a judge.</strong></p>

<p>Prominent Malaysian blogger and government critic Raja Petra Kamaruddin is greeted by supporters after being freed from jail by a court in Shah Alam, outside Kuala Lumpur city, on Friday</p>
<p>Mr Raja Petra, 58, editor of the website Malaysia Today, has been held without trial for eight weeks under a draconian security law, the ISA.</p>
<p>He had been accused of causing ethnic tensions by ridiculing Islam.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm really glad it's over,&quot; a tearful, haggard Mr Raja Petra said as he hugged his family and greeted supporters. <!-- E SF --></p>
<p>&quot;I'm really tired. The judge's decision proves that there was no justification for my detention.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to fight all-out and get the ISA abolished,&quot; he told reporters, referring to the Internal Security Act, which allows detention without charge for an initial two years, with indefinite extensions possible.</p>
<p>Mr Raja Petra was garlanded by supporters and then driven home in a maroon Rolls Royce which one of them had provided, said one report from the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Critical</strong></p>
<p>Mr Raja Petra was freed from a notorious prison camp in northern Malaysia on the orders of the high court in Shah Alam city near Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>It ruled that Interior Minister Syed Hamid Albar had overstepped his authority when he ordered the detention.</p>
<p>Mr Raja Petra has increasingly angered the Malaysian authorities with his critical Malaysia Today website, the country's best-known political blog.</p>
<p>He still faces charges of sedition for an article he published which linked Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak to the 2006 murder of a Mongolian woman, Altantuya Shaariibuu.</p>
<p>Mr Najib, who has consistently denied any involvement, is widely expected to take over as prime minister when incumbent Abdullah Badawi agrees on a transition date.</p>
<p><strong>'Great day'</strong></p>
<p>Raja Petra's lawyer, Malik Imtiaz, described Friday's ruling as &quot;historic&quot;, saying it was the first time a court had ordered the release of an ISA detainee since the government banned such rulings in 1989.</p>
<p>It was &quot;definitely a wonderful step in terms of civil liberties in Malaysia&quot;, he said.</p>
<p>His words were echoed by Malaysia's human rights commissioner, Denison Jayasooria, who called it a &quot;great day for human rights and fundamental liberties&quot;, according to AFP news agency.</p>
<p>He called for the ISA to be used only &quot;where there is a real threat to national security&quot;.</p>
<p>Mr Raja Petra was arrested on 12 September under the ISA as part of a government clampdown on opposition voices.</p>
<p>He was arrested along with opposition deputy Teresa Kok and journalist Tan Hoon Cheng, both of whom have since been released</p>
