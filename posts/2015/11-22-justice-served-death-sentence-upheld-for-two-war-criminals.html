        <p>During the early morning hours of November 22, Bangladesh carried out the death sentences for two notorious war criminals of 1971. They were Salahuddin Quader (SQ) Chowdhury and Ali Ahsam Mohammed Mujahid (or Mojaheed).</p>
<p>The convicted were accused of taking part in mass murders and assassinations of innocent Bengalis during the 1971 liberation struggle against Pakistan. Both SQ Chowdhury and Mujahid were rehabilitated in politics by two former Bangladesh Presidents, Ziaur Rahman and Hossain Ershad, after the killing of the founding leader of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1971.</p>
<p>It is quite bewildering to the people of Bangladesh that the western press and human rights organizations kept referring to these two convicted people as opposition leaders and not war criminals. It is also quite frustrating to see the myopic vision of the United States with respect to its foreign policy; it bombs ISIS in Iraq and Syria, but at the same time issues statements in support of these criminals in Bangladesh who, through their actions, were no less than ISIS terrorists.</p>
<p>We consider the carrying out of the verdict against these two war criminals as a step towards achieving some closure for the injustice that the Bengalis suffered during 1971. Forty four years have passed since 1971, many of the perpetrators of crime have died without facing charges. The surviving Pakistani Army officers and soldiers who carried out the bulk of the atrocity, including genocide and mass rape, remain outside the jurisdiction. However, we consider this verdict by the International War Crimes Tribunal and its execution by the Bangladesh Government a proxy indictment for all war criminals of 1971.</p>
<p>Below we provide the charges brought against the convicted; without reading them you would not get the total scope of the heinous acts committed by SQ Chowdhury and Mujahid.</p>
<p><em>Charges against SQ Chowdhury</em></p>
<p>A total of 23 charges have been brought against war criminal Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. He was found guilty in nine out of the 23 charges leveled against him by the prosecution. He was sentenced to death over four charges and jailed for different terms over the five others.</p>
<p>He got the capital punishment for each of the four charges: #3, #5, #6 and #8 — that include murder, genocide and murder after abduction. He was also given 20 years in prison for three charges: #2, #4, and #7 – each which include murder, complicity in genocide, loot, arson and deportation; and five years each for another two charges – #17 and #18, which include abduction and torture.</p>
<p>The charges against SQ Chowdhury are given below :</p>
