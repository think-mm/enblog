<p>Halloween or Hallowe'en, a contraction of all Hallows' Evening, is a celebration brought to the USA by the Irish and Scottish immigrants in 19th century. In the late 20th century this celebration of Halloween was also observed in other western countries. Now, in the present time Halloween is celebrated in almost all the western countries namely, USA, Canada, Ireland, UK, and many other countries. Other than the countries mentioned earlier it is observed being celebrated in countries like Japan in Asia, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. According to the popular belief among the people of Irish, British Welsh community, the pagan god of death Samhain (SAH-win) calls upon all the souls/ spirits of the dead people. According to the belief, in that night all the man made laws are no longer active and the dead spirits are allowed to join the world of alive world. They also believed that, all the dead spirits lived in a land in the form of immortal youngs, and were called &quot;Tir nan Oge&quot;. Some believed that the dead ones lived with angels.</p>
<p>It was told in a folklore that, all the dead ones come to the alive world in order to take on a new body form for the upcoming new year, in the night of 31st October. In order to be protected from the influence of evil spirits necessary precautions are taken. Such a ritual was to make new sacred fire in the next dawn, which symbolizes also the upcoming new year.</p>
<p>In Britain and Ireland the clerics would reunite in a dark mountain in the Oak Forest in order to make sacred fire and to sacrifice seeds and animals. They would dance and sing around the fire till dawn, in a belief that would show the path to the destiny in the upcoming year. In the dawn, the clerics would wear the coal which was burned from each families.</p>

<p>Halloween was also celebrated in Bangladesh in 21st century. The first wave plunged on to Humayun Azad. Then it started with the murder of Rajib Haider on 15 February 2013. Then it maintained its pace by killing Avijit Roy. Bangladeshi Halloween is completely different from that of other countries.</p>
<p>The history of religious killing is very old. The evil practice of religious killing is brought to this century by the fanatic religious people. In recent times the celebration of Halloween is also  observed in the Islamic countries as well as in India. But it is now a big event for the Islamic Mullahs. Halloween is celebrated in many countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Islamic countries. Islamic fanatics believe that the free thinking writers call upon the people to the freedom and thus their religious cheating business are under threat. Although the Halloween is celebrated in a particular day in western countries, it is celebrated whenever the time seems right in fanatic religious countries. It is celebrated by killing of two writers in a same day, or the celebration can be postponed for months for the lacking of &quot;chances&quot;.</p>
<p>Fanatic religious people believe that the blessings of god rains down upon then whenever they celebrate Halloween in their own terms. As many as 72 of whores and gelmans are be reserved for their life after death. Westerns believe that the in the day of Halloween dead souls come to the living world to take a new body, and the fanatics believe that the whores begin waiting for them since that day. Religious Fanatics believe that their place in heaven is confirmed as soon as they book a place for the writers in hell.</p>
<p>In western countries people get dressed as horror figures, but in Bangladesh a guy having beard wearing long white gown is an iconic horror figure.</p>
