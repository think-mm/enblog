        <p>Once upon a time, I fell in love with a girl whose nose was carved in the middle of it. I was proud of her, thinking in mind that apart from her there was no girl in all over the world who had a curved nose. Her curved nose, mainly, caused me a great fascination for her.</p>
<p>However, having thrown me in the ocean of grief, the girl with a curved nose got married to the boy, one of my friends, to whom she was abundantly devoted. Since they have been married, a long time has passed away. In the meantime, I didn't see her even for one time. At length, two months ago, I came with a chance of meeting her. Her husband got admission in a hospital with heart disease. I scarcely heard the tidings than I, accompanied by a friend, went to the hospital cabin rented by them really to see the girl, but pretending to console her sick husband in his plight. When I entered the cabin, she was in the bathroom showering herself. I thought she was not in the room and felt distress because I assumed that if not today, I would not get any further chance to see her in the near future, and as before long days would pass away without seeing her.</p>
<p>As I was chatting, sitting upon a stool, with her husband lying down on the patient bed and her father and mother in law seated upon a sofa, she suddenly came out of the bathroom and addressed me directly, &quot;Hi, what's up? How long I haven't seen you!&quot; I squinted at her face while answering her formalities and questioning about her business. In my great bewilderment, I noticed that her nose was no longer curved and perceived that my adoration for her almost had been erased from the heart.</p>
<p>Thought over the problem repeatedly some days and been unable to gather any slightest idea, I conversed about it with a friend to make a proper solution. She tried to convince me saying that the girl, perhaps, had her nose done any medical treatment or an operation to get it straight like others. I couldn't rely on her opinion entirely, and the matter appeared to me still so much vague. So I decided to inquire her some photographs taken long ago or on those days when my heart had been fully dedicated to her. Now the question was where I would get some photographs of her of the old days. In the course of time, through a friend I came to know that she had a Facebook account. Then I searched for her account in the online and got it very easily. Fortunately, there were some of her photographs of those days in her profile. I scrutinized those photographs very carefully, but I couldn't find her nose curved in any of those photographs. In every photograph her nose appeared to be as straight as on the day I last saw her in the hospital.</p>
