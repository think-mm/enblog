<p>&quot;God, Please, protect us from the tiger.&quot;</p>
<p>The God said, Okay.</p>
<p>A moment later, the tiger made a complaint to God, &quot;Men have inflicted torture on us. We have been running away in terror from one forest to another. The hunter always chases us. Please, save us from them.&quot;</p>
<p>The God said, Okay.</p>

<p>Harihar Bhattacharya was going to court to file a lawsuit against his nephew. He said to God, &quot;I have been performing puja all my life. Also, I become frail due to fasting. I want to teach him a good lesson. Please, God, support me.&quot;</p>

<p>Shushil will sit for exams. Every day, he said to God, &quot;Master, make me pass the exams.&quot; Today, he told God, &quot;If you have the scholarship obtained me, I will conduct a horirlut*, spending five tk.&quot;</p>
<p>The God said, Okay.</p>
<p>Haren Purakayastha wished to be the chairman of the District Board. He requested God via, Kali, a priest, &quot;I need eleven votes!&quot; Having received an honorarium, the priest, irritated God, pronouncing erroneous Sanskrit mantra.</p>
<p>The God said, Okay, Okay.</p>

<p>A sick kid's mother pleaded to God, &quot;It's my only child. Please, Lord, don't take him away from me.&quot;</p>
<p>The God said, Okay.</p>
<p>An elderly woman, aunt Khenti, from next door told God about the mother, &quot;Hey Creator, she is an arrogant woman. Wearing new Jewelry, she swelled like a turkey-cock. You have done a great job by making her child suffer. Punish her a little more.&quot;</p>
<p>The God said, Okay.</p>

<p>A novice writer from Bangladesh told God, &quot;No editor publishes my write-ups. I long to publish them in the Probasi*. Tell Ramananda Babu to be sympathetic to me.&quot;</p>
<p>The God said, Okay.</p>
<p>When the God had a scope, he said to the Brahma, sitting next to him, &quot;Do you have pure mustard oil in your home?&quot;</p>
<p>The Brahma said, &quot;Yes. But why?&quot;</p>
<p>The God: &quot;I require it. Would you like to give me a little?&quot;</p>
<p>The Brahma: &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>
<p>No sooner mustard oil came from Brahma's adobe than the God poured a little into his nose and fell deep asleep.</p>
<p>He hasn't woken up yet.</p>
