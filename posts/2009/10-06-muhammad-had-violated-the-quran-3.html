<p style="line-height: 15.6pt;" align="justify"><strong><span style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Muhammad violated the Quranic rule of not to have sex with women when in ihram (purity state spent inside a mosque) or performing Hajj</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Here is the Quranic verse on the purity state in a mosque:</p>
<p align="justify">Observe Hajj in the prescribed month; no sexual intercourse, misconduct and argument during the Hajj session… Q 2:197</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">YUSUFALI: For Hajj are the months well known. If any one undertakes that duty therein, Let there be no obscenity, nor wickedness, nor wrangling in the Hajj. And whatever good ye do, (be sure) Allah knoweth it. And take a provision (With you) for the journey, but the best of provisions is right conduct. So fear Me, o ye that are wise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">You can have sex with wives only at nights of fasting time; wives are garments; do not approach wife while in retreat (ihram) in a mosque... Q 2:187:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">YUSUFALI: Permitted to you, on the night of the fasts, is the approach to your wives. They are your garments and ye are their garments. Allah knoweth what ye used to do secretly among yourselves; but He turned to you and forgave you; so now associate with them, and seek what Allah Hath ordained for you, and eat and drink, until the white thread of dawn appear to you distinct from its black thread; then complete your fast Till the night appears; but do not associate with your wives while ye are in retreat in the mosques. Those are Limits (set by) Allah: Approach not nigh thereto. Thus doth Allah make clear His Signs to men: that they may learn self-restraint.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 15.6pt;" align="justify">Even a hadis in Sunaan Abu Dawud confirms the stipulation of the Quran. This hadis says: <em>A pilgrim must not marry and give someone in marriage in the sacred state (while wearing ihram)… (</em>Sunaan Abu Dawud, 2.10.1837):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Nubaih b. Wahb, brother of Banu 'Abd al-Dar said: 'Umar b. 'Ubaid Allah sent someone to Aban b. 'Uthman b. 'Affan, asking him (to participate in the marriage ceremony). Aban in those days was the chief of pilgrims, and both were in the sacred state (wearing ihram). I want to give the daughter of Shaibah b. Jubair to Talhah b. 'Umar in marriage. I wish that you may attend it. Aban refused and said: I heard my father 'Uthman b. 'Affan narrating a tradition from the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: A pilgrim may not marry and give someone in marriage in the sacred state (while wearing ihram).</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">But Muhammad did not have much regard for the Quran, or even to his own words when it came to marrying women and having sex with them during those sacred states. When he went to Mecca, to perform the Hajj, and he received a proposal of marriage, he quickly accepted the offer and married the woman even though he was in sacred state, wearing ihram.</p>
<p style="line-height: 15.6pt;" align="justify">Here is the hadis from Sunaan Abu Dawud: <em>Muhammad married Maimunah while he was in the sacred state wearing ihram… </em>(Sunaan Abu Dawud, 2.10.1840):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Ibn 'Abbas said: The Prophet (may peace be upon him) married Maimunah while he was in the sacred state (wearing ihram).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 15.6pt;" align="justify"> </p>
<p style="line-height: 15.6pt;" align="justify"><strong><span style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Muhammad violated the Quran by having sex with a girl presented to him as a gift</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">The Quran allows Muslims to have sex with their wives and with their sex slaves (without marrying them). The sex slaves include women captives of war, slave women bought in a slave market, and domestic maidservants bought to do house chores. Sex with such sex-slaves does not constitute fornication or adultery. The Quran provides certain exemptions to Muhammad. Allah allowed only Muhammad to have unrestricted sex without marriage with his first cousin sisters, and women who willingly surrender her person to him.</p>
<p align="justify">Here are the concerned verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">023.001
YUSUFALI: The believers must (eventually) win through,
023.002
YUSUFALI: Those who humble themselves in their prayers;
023.003
YUSUFALI: Who avoid vain talk;
023.004
YUSUFALI: Who are active in deeds of charity;
023.005
YUSUFALI: Who abstain from sex,
023.006
YUSUFALI: Except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or (the captives) whom their right hands possess,- for (in their case) they are free from blame,</blockquote>
<p align="justify">In connection with the above verses, ibn Kathir writes that right hand's possession means captive women. According to Jalalyn (and all classical Islamic jurists for that matter), right hand's possession means concubines, and, as per ibn Abbas it is lawful to have unlimited sex with slave women and/or captive women. Ibn Kathir also writes that illegal sex means fornication, and homosexuality; sex with women other than wives and slave-girl is transgression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">033.050
YUSUFALI: O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee; and daughters of thy paternal uncles and aunts, and daughters of thy maternal uncles and aunts, who migrated (from Makka) with thee; and any believing woman who dedicates her soul to the Prophet if the Prophet wishes to wed her;- this only for thee, and not for the Believers (at large); We know what We have appointed for them as to their wives and the captives whom their right hands possess;- in order that there should be no difficulty for thee. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Quran, however, never permitted Muhammad or any Muslims to engage in sex with girls presented to him or the Muslims as honoured gifts. But Muhammad had very little regard for what Allah said in the Quran. He did whatever he wished with women, whom he fancied.</p>
<p align="justify">So, when Muqwaqis, the Christian Ruler of Alexandria presented Muhammad with Mariyah Qibtia (ibn Ishaq, p. 653), a pretty and sexy young girl, Muhammad could not resist himself to engage in sex with her. In fact, he purportedly impregnated her, and she gave birth to Ibrahim, Muhammad's only son who survived for 18 months.</p>
<p align="justify">The entire Sura Tahrim (Sura 66) deals with this issue.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us read a hadis to witness how Muhammad violated the Quran by having sex with Mariyah, the Coptic girl.</p>
<p align="justify">This hadis is very long. I am quoting only the relevant part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas
…'Umar told the whole story (about his wife). "On that the Prophet smiled." 'Umar further said, "I then said, 'I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion ('Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.' The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn't see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah's Apostle) "Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?' The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, 'O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.' I asked the Prophet . 'Please ask Allah's forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to 'Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, 'You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.' The Prophet said, 'The month is also of twenty-nine days.' That month consisted of twenty-nine days. 'Aisha said, 'When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, 'I am telling you something, but you needn't hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents." 'Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said:--
<p align="justify">'O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, ... then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In (Sic) a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And (Sic) His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.' (33.28) 'Aisha said, 'Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.' After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as 'Aisha did."</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="line-height: 15.6pt;" align="justify"> </p>
<p style="line-height: 15.6pt;" align="justify"><strong><span style="background-color: #c0c0c0;">Muhammad violated the Quranic prescription for Islamic sex-offenders</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">The Quran (24:2) says that the punishment for adultery/illicit sex is one hundred lashes in the presence of a Muslim crowd. It also stipulates the house arrest until death for women who resort to lewdness (4:15). Some Islamic scholars are of the opinion that verse 4:15 means lesbianism. Interestingly, there is no prescribed punishment for gays resorting to sodomy (4:16). Verse 4:16 even prescribes forgiveness if the gay couple repent and turn to heterosexual act. To remove such ambiguity and unfairness vis-à-vis gender, ibn Kathir writes that verse 24:2 replaces verses 4:15‑16. Even if we accept ibn Kathir's interpretation, we find no verse in the Quran that clearly says illicit sexual offenders face stoning to death.</p>
<p align="justify">Let us read theses verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">024.002
YUSUFALI: The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication,- flog each of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day: and let a party of the Believers witness their punishment.
<p align="justify">004.015
YUSUFALI: If any of your women are guilty of lewdness, Take the evidence of four (Reliable) witnesses from amongst you against them; and if they testify, confine them to houses until death do claim them, or Allah ordain for them some (other) way.
<p align="justify">004.016
YUSUFALI: If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone; for Allah is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Even a hadis in Sahih Muslim tells us that stoning to death had never been a part of the Quran.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Stoning is not in the Quran, Umar instituted it claiming it to be part of the Quran…</em> (Sahih Muslim 17.4194):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">'Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported that 'Umar b. Khattab sat on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Verily Allah sent Muhammad (may peace be upon him) with truth and He sent down the Book upon him, and the verse of stoning was included in what was sent down to him. We recited it, retained it in our memory and understood it. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is pregnancy, or a confession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Here is how Muhammad, violating the Quran, punished a few sex offenders.</p>
<p align="justify">A man and a woman were stoned to death near funeral prayer spot in the mosque...(Sahih Bukhari 2.23.413):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:
The Jew brought to the Prophet a man and a woman from amongst them who have committed (adultery) illegal sexual intercourse. He ordered both of them to be stoned (to death), near the place of offering the funeral prayers beside the mosque."</blockquote>
<p align="justify">A married woman committed adultery with an unmarried man. The man received one hundred lashes and exiled for a year. Muhammad asked Unais to go to the woman and stone her to death…(Sahih Bukhari 3.49.860):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Narrated Abu Huraira and Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:
A bedouin came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Judge between us according to Allah's Laws." His opponent got up and said, "He is right. Judge between us according to Allah's Laws." The Bedouin said, "My son was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I paid a ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the learned scholars who said, "Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to be exiled for one year." The Prophet said, "No doubt I will judge between you according to Allah's Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go back to you, and your son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile." He then addressed somebody, "O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death" So, Unais went and stoned her to death.</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Muhammad ordered the stoning of a man for confessing adultery; Jabir Ibn Abdullah participated in the throwing of stones…(Sahih Bukhari 8.82.806):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Narrated Abu Huraira:
A man came to Allah's Apostle while he was in the mosque, and he called him, saying, "O Allah's Apostle! I have committed illegal sexual intercourse.'" The Prophet turned his face to the other side, but that man repeated his statement four times, and after he bore witness against himself four times, the Prophet called him, saying, "Are you mad?" The man said, "No." The Prophet said, "Are you married?" The man said, "Yes." Then the Prophet said, 'Take him away and stone him to death." Jabir bin 'Abdullah said: I was among the ones who participated in stoning him and we stoned him at the Musalla. When the stones troubled him, he fled, but we over took him at Al-Harra and stoned him to death.</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Ali stoned a lady to death on a Friday as per Muhammad's tradition...(Sahih Bukhari 8.82.803):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Narrated Ash-Sha'bi:
from 'Ali when the latter stoned a lady to death on a Friday. 'Ali said, "I have stoned her according to the tradition of Allah's Apostle.</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Muhammad ordered that a woman adulteress to be stoned to death after she finished suckling (wean) her child; Khalid even abused when she was being stoned to death…(Sahih Muslim 17.4206):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">'Abdullah b. Buraida reported on the authority of his father that Ma'iz b. Malik al-Aslami came to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, I have wronged myself; I have committed adultery and I earnestly desire that you should purify me. He turned him away. On the following day, he (Ma'iz) again came to him and said: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) turned him away for the second time, and sent him to his people saying: Do you know if there is anything wrong with his mind. They denied of any such thing in him and said: We do not know him but as a wise good man among us, so far as we can judge. He (Ma'iz) came for the third time, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent him as he had done before. He asked about him and they informed him that there was nothing wrong with him or with his mind. When it was the fourth time, a ditch was dug for him and he (the Holy Prophet) pronounced judgment about him and he was stoned. He (the narrator) said: There came to him (the Holy Prophet) a woman from Ghamid and said: Allah's Messenger, I have committed adultery, so purify me. He (the Holy Prophet) turned her away. On the following day she said: Allah's Messenger, Why do you turn me away? Perhaps, you turn me away as you turned away Ma'iz. By Allah, I have become pregnant. He said: Well, if you insist upon it, then go away until you give birth to (the child). When she was delivered she came with the child (wrapped) in a rag and said: Here is the child whom I have given birth to. He said: Go (Sic) away and suckle him until you wean him. When she had weaned him, she came to him (the Holy Prophet) with the child who was holding a piece of bread in his hand. She said: Allah's Apostle, here is he as I have weaned him and he eats food. He (the Holy Prophet) entrusted the child to one of the Muslims and then pronounced punishment. And she was put in a ditch up to her chest and he commanded people and they stoned her. Khalid b Walid came forward with a stone which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he abused her. Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) heard his (Khalid's) curse that he had hurried (Sic) upon her. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Khalid, be gentle. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, she has made such a repentance that even if a wrongful tax-collector were to repent, he would have been forgiven. Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.</p>
