As a matter of fact human civilization has been developed with ever increasing dependence on electricity. Bangladesh is a country that needs about 5,000 Megawatt (rounded figure) of electricity at present. The current per day production is about 3,000 Megawatt, that shows a clear deficit of about 2,000 Megawatt. Even though various programs and slogans of the government (like, providing digital technology in all spheres necessitating spending of huge sum) may indicate that the country is extremely rich, the fact is in the true sense the country is really poor. The country could not still employ the requisite number of personnel in its various administrative, service and maintenance sectors, not to say anything about the poor and inadequate facilities provided to the employed personnel. </span></p>

The 1991-'96 BNP government left an extremely shameful record of producing electricity in the country. Te following Awami League government (1996-2001) could somehow solve the problem, of course with some genuine criticism. The reason for criticism was :<span> </span>the Awami League government arranged "barge-mounted plants" because such plants could be commissioned within minimum time. The suppliers were successful in understanding the urgency of the government. Naturally they compelled the government to sign a contract in which the government had to pay them at a higher rate than what they used to collect from the consumers. The amount of this subside reached to such a state that even when there was shortage of power and the barge-mounted suppliers were ready with the same, the government could not purchase due to financial constraints. </span></p>

Constructed at an extremely high cost, this plant is capable of producing electricity at the cheapest rate. It is known that some of the generators of this project are out of order. The government may take up program for replacing those. However, any program for further extension of this project may not be wise because of the following reason :<span> </span>the efficiency of this project depends upon the height of water in the dam, which again depends upon rainfall n the upper catchment area and silting inside the lake. Both these factors are unpredictable and beyond human control. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-CA"></span></p>

The process includes vigorous task of information collection, comparative analysis, availability of fund, cost-benefit analysis on the basis of maintenance cost, cost of fuel, site selection, life span of the plant etc.<span> </span>Naturally the job needs considerable time. The type which can be procured and established within the shortest time is the barge-mounted type. However, the capacity of such type is quite low, cost of production of unit energy is quite high and the experience with this type in Bangladesh is not encouraging. </span></p>

The fact is, in the scale we are discussing about electricity, there is absolutely no possibility of Bangladesh to achieve any benefit from this source. Production of large scale solar energy is worth producing in countries with cloud-free sky and open deserts, both of which are absent in Bangladesh. At present a number of solar cell manufacturers from the developed countries and having blessings of international organizations are constantly shouting to say, as if solar energy can act as substitute for normal electricity.<span> </span></span></p>

Such plants may be procured easily and at a relatively cheap price, because manufacturers of such plants in the developed countries are already facing liability regarding the sale of their products. In such plant the rate of production may also be less.<span> </span>The cheapest and cleanest fuel "heavy water" is available in the country. Other fuels also will be available, even though their handling and after-use disposal is extremely hazardous. The major problem of such plant is the "possibility of accident". A country with negligible number of experts in this field would have to considerably depend on foreign experts, which also is quite risky. Also the propensity of climatic (like, storm, cyclone etc.) and geo-tectonic (like, earth quake) hazards in Bangladesh do not indicate good prospect of this type.<span> </span></span></p>

In such project there should not be any hurry and adequate time should be allowed in all phases.<span> </span></span></p>

This time seems quite reasonable or rather conservative. The net findings of all written above indicates that the country may not get the requisite quantity of electricity within the next 3 or 4 years. In the mean time people have already started agitation for their sufferings, the industrialists and businessmen for business-loss due to it. Naturally solving this problem has appeared as the first challenge before the Awami League government.</span></p>

One expert opined in the newspaper that about 1500 Megawatt of power is needed per day during the pick season. The production of crop depends upon irrigation, and not the type pump used for his purpose. We have seen that in Rangpur district vast areas of land is irrigated by the women by using "Tara-pump".<span> </span>Other than "Tara-pump" a better and bigger version of men operated pump was devised by Late Prof. Dr. Fashi Uddin Ahmed (ex-Planning Minister). It is sea-saw type, portable and can irrigate water from natural sources and tube-wells. At present most of the electric or diesel pump operators themselves are not the cultivators, but are middle-men who sell water to the farmers. It is not possible to find out which of the three types of water pumps for irrigation is economic without having detail information. But we can mention the various factors on which this economics depends. Those with little intelligence may be able to assess the situation by understanding these factors. </span></p>

When such a pump lifts water, the underground water table goes down at a rapid rate creating two problems :<span> </span>when the level of underground water goes much below (due to excessive lifting or because of dry season) the pump can no more lift water. This factor should be given more importance in view of the melting of Himalayan icecaps, resulting in lowering of water level in the rivers and underground water table. Lowering of water table at ever increasing rate may also agitate the lower level, where Arsenic usually exists. When the serving area of a pump is large, it needs wide drains and branches, thus spoiling cultivatable land. </span></p>

On the other hand, the farmers may be benefited because seemingly the cost of water by this pump should be less than that by electric pumps.<span> </span></span></p>

What the authorities would have to do are : (a) Earmarking the areas with large concentration of electric pumps. (b) Issuing notice to farmers under each pump to use manual pumps within certain period (say, two months), (c) Making manual pumps available to such farmers on cash payment or easy loan, (d) Issuing order that no electricity would be supplied to such pumps after a certain period of time. This part of the job should be handled jointly by the electricity and agriculture authorities. </span></p>

In such case the government gets negligible tax from the industries. A government severely suffering from electricity crisis should in no way allow the scope for tax evasion. So, they should declare "end of the tax-holiday policy" immediately and also declare withdrawal of electricity from the "losing industries". By closing such industries the government would not only clog tax evasion, but also fruitless use of electricity. </span></p>

The air-conditioned posh shopping complexes of the cities fall under this category. It is now known to all that such shopping complexes sell common peoples' items at reduced rate only as a camouflage. Their profit lies in the imported goods, where the buyers are extremely rich and the shops can sell the goods at any rate they wish. Thus they have wide scope of increasing their income. At present electricity generated by generator is costlier than that supplied by the government authority. So, even if the owners of posh complexes use generators, they can easily take care of the additional cost from their rich customers. </span></p>

And for this definitely the government would have to follow the ideal procedure. But the truth is, it would need time. The quickest way of procuring barge-mounted plants did not give satisfactory result in the past. So, this time the government should take proper time for taking the most appropriate decision. The finance minister has said that the process may need three years or more. However, the newly elected government must realize that they do not have dearth of enemies at home and abroad. Scarcity of electricity leads to tremendous sufferings of the people. So, if it continues, the enemies may be successful in getting the dissatisfied electricity-users with them. That clearly says, the problem must be solved now. </span></p>

When a problem cannot be solved in the traditional way, endeavours should be made for alternate solutions. In this article I have mentioned such a solution for the consideration of relevant authorities of the government. I have not mentioned adequate data and specific information in this article, because (i) neither I am in a position to have such data and information, (ii) nor I feel those are necessary to understand this easy problem and the even easier solution. It is the duty of the government to collect those information (in case they do not already have) in order to study the problem and find out the effective and most appropriate solution. </span></p>
