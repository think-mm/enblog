        <p>&quot;Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall,&quot; wrote William Shakespeare, expressing the concept of sin in his own way, painting with his pen a vivid picture of &quot;sin&quot; and &quot;sinners&quot;. The mysterious concept of sin starts in religion as a way of introducing the supremacy of a perfect God, while Satan emerges from mystery, as eternal evil seems to be produced out of an eternal entity.</p>
<p>In the Abrahamic traditions, sin came into being at the creation of the world, when Satan was introduced, Eve sinned, Adam fell for Eve, God triumphed and the age of infinity began. It remains a mystery what the source of perfect evil was that produced Satan, how evil came out of the holiest place, and how evil defeated the perfect God and his creation.</p>
<p>The ever evil out highest holiness comes reveal the highest degree of holiness as God, Godly and highest evil, satanic as the Satan both are the same source of different outlook indeed. In Abrahamic concepts, Jesus claimed that he came for the sinners; on the other hand, the Prophet Mohammed shared his expertness on sin and sinner and Satanic that revels the &quot;satanic verses&quot;, while many prophet fall in sin are tilled as sinner and the Jesus was bound to come as man to defeat the Satan in mortal body although he is the God of that Eden where Adam, eve and Sin was prevailed before the world.
The reason and result of introduction to Sin, Sinner and Satan, does really introduce two absolute powers one is GOD and other ever evil &quot;Satan&quot;. That creates the deeds goodly is from and of God and the evil things goes to &quot;Satan&quot; and that is satanic.</p>
<p>The mystic myths of Sinner and creator of Sin leaves us too many questions, such as: what created sin, why and how, and can God sin or not?</p>
<p>A religion without a God or goddess is something like a strong man or sexy woman without penis or vagina or sexual power. God without Sin or Satan become improper while the man will be not less than God or Satan. While the most negative idea of Sin and relative Satan come out of positive God the mystery mist in the root in God.</p>
<p>While the same source triumphed climax &quot;Satan&quot; and &quot;God&quot; fight to show their supremacy, man becomes the victim of democracy by Dictator God –Satan of Eden. The sin and Satan by the ages triumph while the God become defeated, where there is doubts what the mystery is behind defining rightly God and Satan –Sin.
Conceptions of Sin and God vary widely in Deism, Henotheism, Monolatrism
Monotheism or in Panentheism but one main thing is very common in very sorts of religion there is God and Sin and sounds strongly.</p>
<p>The God, Sin-satan become the moving force of the world that those who run the world the forces, forces them strongly. The dynasty and nations fall down in Sin and on God; many nations had formed in the basis of religion a vital vehicle God, sin and Satan.
The religion is the constructive idea of satanic mystery now the politics become the one of the carrier of religions as Seneca said Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.</p>
<p>Currently many religions are recognized as state religions in some countries. There are state based on Christianity, Islam and Buddhism. Where two major countries were fighting to setup their supremacy of religion many were killed where the sin sounds strange on the blooded road, the God remain defeated before the Sin, sinner and Satan triumphs. The twin tower was twisted where the religious extremist was strongly active behind the process and Al –Qida was suspected on that where again the religion in other sense the religion become the inspiration behind all these brutality. As God is busy to prove that Satan is worst, all the religion is fighting to prove that &quot; I am right and you are wrong&quot; the fight between Satanic sources continues, the Eden mystery continues in critical flavor. The last version of Eden mystery represent the religion &quot;Islam&quot; and the fight continues among the Satanic mystics and that cause the world a lot , while the politics , economy, environment</p>
<p>If you look at a report on global Muslim population the things will be clear , how deeply the race of religions are going on in different races ,the comprehensive demographic study of Pew Forum in more than 200 countries stated that global Muslim population stands at 1.57 billion, meaning that nearly 1 in 4 people in the world practice Islam. , representing 23% of an estimated 2009 world population of 6.8 billion.</p>
<p>The Eden mystery of Sin and Satanic dilemma is now causing the world and will leave the world the on more Satanic sources while the sin will sound stronger in coming days, if the world fails to bring an end to the satanic mystery of Eden,the satanic mystery will bring an end of the world.</p>
