<h2><span style="font-size: small; color: #800080;"><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/?p=69">After 1st Part</a>...</span></span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em><span style="color: red">A note to the readers:
</span></em><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/?p=69">In part one</a> I wrote that verses 2:51 and 7:142 contradicted. However, the Qur'an says in both the verses that Moses appointment with Allah was for forty nights. Verse 2:51 clearly says forty nights. Yusuf Ali translates 7:142 in this manner (to be fair, please ignore Yusuf Ali's insertions inside the parentheses):</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>7:142 YUSUFALI:</strong> We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed (the period) with ten (more): thus was completed the term (of communion) with his Lord, forty nights. And Moses had charged his brother Aaron (before he went up): "Act for me amongst my people: Do right, and follow not the way of those who do mischief."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><a href="https://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1115&amp;Itemid=62">Ibn Kathir</a>  explains the ambiguity in this manner:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">'Allah reminds the Children of Israel of the guidance that He sent to them by speaking directly to Musa and revealing the Tawrah to him. In it, was their law and the details of their legislation. Allah stated here that He appointed thirty nights for Musa. The scholars of Tafsir said that Musa fasted this period, and when they ended, Musa cleaned his teeth with a twig. Allah commanded him to complete the term adding ten more days, making the total forty. When the appointed term finished, Musa was about to return to Mount Tur.'</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This explanation is confusing. To say the least—could it that Allah's instruction to Moses was to fast during night (forty nights in total) and seek audience with Allah during the day (forty days in total). It could be either. I chose the first option: that is Moses fasted during nights and met Allah during day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nevertheless, it appears ibn Kathir might be incorrect if we are to accept the original Arabic version of this verse.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I apologize to the readers for creating misunderstanding because of ibn Kathir's <em>tafsir</em>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<h2><span style="color: #800080; font-family: Verdana;">Sura 3: al‑Imran (The Family of Imran)</span></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:2
</strong>Worship none but Allah; He is the ever‑living, and the sustainer of all things.

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:7
</strong>Allah has sent down the Book. Only men of understanding will grasp the messages of the Qur'an; some verses are basic some are allegorical; perverse hearts follow allegorical verses to find hidden meanings to make discord; only Allah knows the hidden meanings of the Qur'an.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 16:103 says the Qur'an is in clear Arabic.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:18
</strong>Allah, His angels, and the knowledgeable people bear witness that none is to be worshipped except Him. Maintaining His creation is justice.

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:42

<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> in 21:98 Allah says all objects worshipped by men besides Allah will be in hell, i.e., Jesus will burn in hell.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:59
</strong>Allah created Adam from dust, Allah said 'be' and Adam was there; Jesus looked like Adam (as Allah made Jesus without a father He made him look like Adam, and because Adam had no father or mother, Allah created Adam from dust—ibn Kathir).
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 38:71 says Allah created Adam out of wet clay..

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:67

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:97
</strong>Mecca is the station of Abraham: if you can afford then perform pilgrimage (hajj) in Mecca; Allah does not need <em>'Alamin'</em>(any of His creatures).
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: in 2:21 Allah says He needs mankind to worship Him.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 51:56 says Allah needs humans and jinns to worship Him.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:125
</strong>In Badr, Allah made a terrific onslaught with five thousand angels. (The angels wore white wool and had special markings distinguishing their horses—ibn Kathir)
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction: </span>8:9 says in Badr, Allah helped the Muslims with one thousand angels.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:144

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:169‑171
</strong>Those slain in Allah's way (in Jihad) do not die; they live in the presence of Allah (in Islamic Paradise), and enjoy His provisions.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 19:70‑71 say every soul, including that of a Muslim, at least for some time, will be in hell.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>3:180
</strong>Allah does not like stingy people; Allah will tie the covetous articles like twisted collars in the necks of unbelievers. Allah is the inheritor of the heavens and the earth.
<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction</span>: 2:116, 3:189, 20:6, 21:19, 57:2 say Allah is the owner of all things in the heavens and in earth.</span>

<span style="color: #0066ff">Contradiction:</span> 2:63 says Allah terrorized Moses' people by raising the Mount Sinai above them.</span>
