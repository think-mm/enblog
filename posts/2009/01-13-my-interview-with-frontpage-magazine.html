<p align="center" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal">By Syed Kamran Mirza</p>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Frontpage Interview's guest today is Dr. Syed Kamran Mirza, the author of Roots of Islamic Terrorism and contributing-author of Beyond Jihad and Leaving Islam-Apostates Speak Out. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>FP:</strong> Dr. Mirza, welcome to Frontpage Interview.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Mirza</strong>:   Many thanks for having me to this interview with the Frontpage Magazine.</font><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana"> </span></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>FP:</strong> Let's begin this discussion with your own background and journey. You were born in a Muslim family in Bangladesh and taught there as teacher in university for many years. Tell us about your upbringing in Islam and how and why you ended up leaving your faith, the consequences etc.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Mirza:</strong> I was born in a traditional Muslim family of Bangladesh. My parents were devout Muslims and their mother tongue was Bengali. In my early childhood days, I was attending religious education every morning (6-8AM) in the <em>Maktab</em> (religious school in the Mosque) before I went to primary school of general education at 10 AM.  There in the <em>Maktab</em> I learned all those Suras/rules/methods required to observe five time prayers, and also learned reading Qur'an in Arabic.  However, I never understood the meaning of any word of Qur'an or Suras, which used to bother me very much. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">I was proud and happy to be a born Muslim since I learned from Mullahs/seniors that—Islam is the ultimate truth and best religion in the whole world.  Qur'an is the infallible words of Allah, who loves only the religion Islam, and all other religions are simply false and bad, they all are "<em>Kafirs</em>" and destined to go to hell. Among the peoples of entire world, Muslims are impeccable human beings, and Allah only loves Muslims. Only Muslims are supposed to go to heaven and nobody else can enter the gate of heaven.  Also, I learned from the Maulanas and Mullahs that—<strong>someday the entire world will be converted to Islam, by the master plan of Allah.</strong> Although, Mullahs told me that Allah loves Muslims or religious persons—I could never see the proper reflection of that in real life.  If, Allah really loves Muslims, then how could he not see distress/sufferings of the poor Muslims? One thing was very strange to me which was the fact that—religion and poverty goes hand in hand.  I mean, poor peoples are always very deeply religious, and rich and affluent were mostly liberal or non-religious.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">During the Bangalis freedom struggle in 1971, I was shocked to discover that almost 95% of Islamists (Islamic clerics—mullahs, maulanas, Qari, Hafez, Madrassah students) were generally supporting Pakistani Military Junta in their cruel suppression of Bengalese freedom movement. They were killing Bangalee men, women, and children (mostly Hindus minorities) by the thousands daily throughout the country, burned thousands of homes, raped thousands of Bangalee women and looted their properties in the name of saving Islam. "Save Pakistan to save Islam" was their slogan. These fanatic Mullahs used to capture young Bangali girls (Mainly Hindus and also Muslims) and supply them to those Pakistani soldiers as Islamic booty (sex slaves) for their service to protecting Islam.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">The Islamists and Mullahs told me: "<em>it is the sacred duty</em> <em>for the Muslims to kill kafirs. Hindus are kafirs therefore it is our duty to kill them</em>!"  I asked him if it is written in Qur'an or <em>hadiths</em> to kill Hindus. The Mullah replied, yes!  At that time, it was not possible to verify Mullah's assertion since I did not understand a word of Arabic and there was no translated Qur'an available to me.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">These Mullahs were supporting Pakistani oppressive force with their mind and body and killing their own Bangali brothers to save pakistan. I could not understand what Islam had to do with our freedom struggle of Bengali nation. <strong>This betrayal of</strong> <strong>Mullahs was the turning point in my faith system of religion</strong>. I could not understand how those persons after reading Qur'an and hadiths (the so-called Allah's books) turned into so a devilish human beings?  Therefore, I immediately decided to investigate what is in the <strong>Qur'an and hadiths</strong> that can make people worst than a ferocious lion!</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">From that day, I started to read Qur'an bit by bit. The more I was reading the holy book, the more I was dismayed day by day.  My intention was to search—divinity, philosophy, science, ethics, morality, social and political issues in Qur'an. But alas! Qur'an was a book that I found with no chronology, no philosophy, no science at all (but had plenty of erroneous sciences), plenty of problems in ethics and morality, ample redundancies, unfit social and political teachings by today's standards; and above all it had ample superstitious scriptures. I also found out that Qur'an is a book full of hatred, cruelties, unethical matters and most of all it has no divinity at all.  I could not find anything that was impossible for mankind to think or say in the 7<sup>th</sup> century period.  Quran is replete with hateful, coercive and killing verses (examples: 5:51, 9:5, 3:85, 8:39, 9:29, 47:4, 2:191). Some of the hateful Quranic verses and Hadiths bothered me most will be cited later in this interview.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">My childhood religious teacher (Huzur Shaheb, a mullah who taught me about religion) always used to tell me that Islam is the only Allah's chosen religion and most peaceful religion on earth. Now it is beyond my comprehension how any deity or religious scriptures can dictate to kill other human beings! My conclusion was that this book Qur'an was manmade as other holy books that predate Islam were; and I came to realization that Prophet Muhammad himself primarily created it for his self-serving adventurous ambitions.  Along with his own self-serving scriptures, he also plagiarized various verses from various books such as Bible, Book of Zoroastrian, other older religions, and local folklores. Qur'an is full of folklores and mythological stories of ancient Arabia.  This was the time when I was taken my faith out of Islam completely, and become a secular humanist. To me, all peoples are same; and I do not make any distinction between any religions.  Finally, I came to term with the notion that religious identity is not at all important to any human being! I ditto with this famous quote below:</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong><em><span style="font-weight: normal">"Religion is an insult to human dignity.  With or without it, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.  But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion</span></em></strong><em>."</em>-- <em><span style="font-style: normal">By Nobel Laureate physicist Steven Weinberger.</span></em> </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>FP:</strong> Your thoughts on the recent Mumbai horror?</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Mirza:</strong> The attacks on Mumbai (Bombay) are part of the global jihadi program by the Islamists. Mumbai horrors of terror, as well as, many other Islamic terrorisms happening sporadically all over the world (both in the territories of  Muslims and non-Muslim nations) are only the part of their larger mission of worldwide Islamic jihadi program declared by Osam-bin-Laden (OBL) in 1998. And these terrorists are doing it in disguise of various Islamic names, as part of their Islamic deceptive techniques, which westerners utterly fail to understand. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Quite often, western Governments and western Medias struggle to understand the puzzles of various names and connection issues and that is futile and unnecessary attempt by them. No matter what name or names these mindless Islamic terrorists do use—there ultimate connection is of course their giant umbrella organization of modern day Islamic Jihad called: <strong>Al-Qaeda</strong>—which is well connected to <strong>Islam and Koranic teachings</strong>. Please consider this analogy: Islamic jihad (terrorism) is a big poisonous tree. Al-Qaeda is the main stem of this tree rooted in the fertile soil (Islam and Koran) and all other hundreds of terrorists in various names are just some branches and sub-branches of the same tree. Taking new names and constantly changing names is the Islamic deceptive technique (just the way disease causing organisms mutates) only to keep non-Muslim western gullibles in the dark and confusions. They all are inter-connected to main stem (al-Qaeda) of this poisonous tree and their objective and goal is exactly the same: to undo western democracies, to destroy western civilization and life style which they dream to replace by their Islamic culture and sharia similar to Talbani Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia—which had been approved by Allah during the 7<sup>th</sup> century period. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Denial and deceptions: </strong>Muslims in general<strong> </strong>will mostly deny that any Muslims are ever involved in Islamic terrorism around the world. Muslims in general and pure Muslims in particular will spread some awkward conspiracy theories blaming America, Israel and India about Mumbai incident. Still today, almost 95% Muslims believe that 9/11 was an American-Jewish conspiracy only to harm peaceful Islam. They may condemn terrorism, but they will never condemn any Islamic terrorists' gang by name and identity and they will always smell some conspiracy theory and will outright disbelieve western Medias. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Most importantly, Muslims in general will never condemn any Islamic terrorism whole heartedly, period. Islamic terrorists are continuously getting silent "nod of consent" from millions of gullible Muslims and hypocritical Islamists. Devout Muslims, (especially in Arab nations, Pakistan and elsewhere) have two-faces: to the western Medias they are professing to oppose terrorism, while in private, they all espouse Islamic jihad which is Islamic terrorisms. Muslims are allowed by Allah to lie for the sake of Islamic success. This is we call Islamic deceptions to fool the western people. I hate to say, Islamists are getting great successes in this hypocritical practice of fooling westerners. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">If we go back to the early history of Islamic propagation in Arabia, Persia, and Northern African nations, we can very comfortably conclude that, this kind of terrorisms did happen obviously in case of Islam, which got the ancient name: Islamic <strong><em>Ghuzawahs </em></strong><em>(surprising attacks to enemy)</em>—the mirror image of today's terrorisms. Prophet of Islam fought at least 90 plus <em>Ghuzawahs </em>during 7<sup>th</sup> century period in order to establish his religion of Islam, by killing, torturing and maiming tens of thousands of innocent Arab Pagans. <em> </em></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>FP:</strong> Who are the prime enemies of Islam?</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Mirza: A</strong>ll human races other than Muslims are the prime enemies of Islam. This includes: all non-believers (Idolaters-Hindus, animists, polytheists, Buddhists) and all people of the books (Christians and Jews). In this modern age of (new tide of Islamic vision started by OBL and his al-Qaeda in 1998) Islamic Jihad, Islamists see the west in general and Israel and America in particular, their prime enemies against Islam. Islam is the most intolerant religion on earth! </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 5pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Islam never accepts or respect any other religion but Islam (Quran-3:85). The basic '<em>montra'</em> of Islam is the divine dictum of '<em>Kalima Tyyaba'</em> which says: <em>"There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger".  </em>The very theme of Islam is: <strong>Allah is the sole creator of everything on heaven and Earth and Muslims are His only legitimate and righteous people.</strong> Remaining all other people (Jews, Christians, Hindus etc.) are simply infidels and hated by Allah. Therefore, in their hearts, Islamists do not recognize any other God or Gods, period. That is the basic reason why most pure Muslims do not respect any other religion and they have big desire to eliminate all other religions and establish Islam as the sole religion on Earth which belongs to only Allah. At least, this is what all pure Muslims like OBL's al-Qaeda Jihadis and also most gullible Muslims do believe. Islam is the only religion that largely forbids the free practice of other religions in its midst. <strong>Saudi Arabia, the cradle of Islam never allows religion other than Islam to practice in their land.</strong> On the contrary, Saudi Arabia is spending hundreds of billions of petro-dollars spread Islam all over the world including America, without any trace of obstacle. Mind that, this is not any so called "radical idea" as the westerners mistakenly like to label them, but this is of course, the real belief system of true Islam established according to Holy Quran and Sunnah. This was the most basic reason why Prophet of Islam declared war against polytheists and he relentlessly fought at least 78 battles killing tens of thousands of unbelieving pagans.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 5pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong><u>What is Islamic terrorism</u>?</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 5pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Islamic terrorism is the divine duty of pure Muslims for which they feel proud instead of feeling remorse. Pure Muslims do not call it terrorism they only call it Islamic Jihad<strong><em> (Ghuzawahs)</em></strong> against the infidel west. Killing non-Muslims are sacred duty of every devout Muslim for which Allah repeatedly commanded (in Qur'an) and declared unlimited reward in the after life. Muslims those who read Qur'an and understand it well always believe in the Islamic 'global agenda' that Islam has a sacred and mandatory God given duty to spread Islamic message (<em>Din-e-Islam</em>) to all the inhabitants of the world. Wars in Iraq or Afghanistan have nothing to do with Islamic terrorism. In American soil 9/11 attacks did happen before Iraq or Afghanistan wars. Please don't forget that.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 5pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Islam is the only religion which divides the whole world into two spheres: Land of Warfare "<strong><em>Darul harb</em></strong>" (non-Islamic nations) and "<strong><em>Darul Islam</em></strong>" (Land of Peace-Muslim nations), and encourages the Land of "Peace" (all Islamic Nations) to fight against the Land of Warfare until it is completely "subdued" and peace (Islam) is established in the entire world. Terrorisms (which according to those Islamists is the holy Jihad) are continued around the whole world only to weaken the economical and moral strength of the western infidels, and 9/11 terrorism was done to destroy American economy! </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 5pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">The world may call them the Islamic terrorists. But, these devout jihadi terrorists are only following the footsteps of their prophet who bragged, "<strong>I have been made victorious with terror</strong>". Below is the sahih hadiths (Prophetic traditions) which tells exactly what I am telling about Islamic terrorism.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 0.05pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><a name="004.052.220"></a></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 0.05pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><em><span style="font-style: normal">Volume 4, Book 52, Number 220, </span></em></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 0.05pt 0pt"><font face="Verdana">Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><em>Allah's Apostle said, "I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and <strong>I have been made victorious with terror </strong>(cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand." Abu Huraira added: Allah's Apostle has left the world and now you, people, are bringing out those treasures (i.e. the Prophet did not benefit by them). </em></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 5pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Their ulterior motive of this modern day jihad is to convert and bring entire mankind under the fold of Islam, the "Only true religion of Allah." To this end—world Muslims can be divided into three main groups (a, b, and c). Two main groups are working very hard. These two groups are: (a) Militant/radical Mullahs (whom we know as the Islamic terrorists—who are engaged in armed Jihad), (b) Educated/elite Western residing true believing Muslims (Muslims belonging to the ummatic groups or organizations in the West such as: AMC, CAIR, ICNA, ISNA, NABIC etc—who are engaged in <strong>"stealth Jihad</strong>" by deceptions and fooling western politicians and gullible publics—by their sweet talks. These group-b Muslims are busy in proselytizing gullible westerners mainly black prisoners, in order to increase Muslim populations—in their master plan of establishing Islamic Sharia laws in the USA.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin: 5pt 0pt" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Here we can exclude (group-c) gullible God fearing innocent so called moderate Muslims, who do not read Qur'an and Sunnah but Muslims only by their birth in the Muslim parents. However, these gullible majority Muslims (group-c) also believe in the same religion of Islam and they never protest or condemn those Islamic terrorists; and also do not object to pray in congregations behind those militant and so called radical mullahs and Imams of the Mosques. In reality, Islamic terrorists in general get tons of supports and moral strengths from all Muslims of the whole world.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>FP:</strong> The place of suicide bombings in Islam?</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Mirza:</strong> Before I elaborate my answer to this very prudent question, let me cite one most important and appropriate quote: <strong><em>"Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction."</em>  </strong>(Blaise Pascal, mathematician, 1670). Holy Quran and sahih (pure) hadiths do encourage believers to commit suicide if necessary, in order to kill infidels/kaffirs, for the sake of Islam. Holy Quran repeatedly promised terrestrial handsome rewards for those who can kill kaffirs (<em>enemy of Allah and His messenger)</em> and dreadful punishing hellfire for those who refuse to kill kaffirs. Muslims believe that <u>their actual life starts after death</u> (afterlife) and they have very little desire to prolong their life in this material world.  Quran also incite followers to sacrifice their lives in order to kill kaffirs in exchange of much better and lucrative after life. In this line <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">just one Quranic verse<u> </u>(9:111)</span></strong> is most attractive to those jihadis who desperately egger to achieve heavenly rearward of 72 virgins. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><u>Here is the master piece verse from Holy Quran inviting suicide</u>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Quran: <a target="_blank" href="https://cwis.usc.edu/dept/MSA/quran/009.qmt.html#009.111" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single"><span style="color: windowtext">9:111</span></a></strong>, <strong>Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Quran.</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Jihadi inspirations always come from Holy Quran and hadiths (Sunnah). There are plenty of such inciting or inspiring Quranic verses which can turn any simple/innocent minded devout Muslims <strong>into a killing monster</strong>. In addition, a strong support and explanation to the verse: 9:111 was given by Merciful Allah by the following: </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Quran-4:74</strong>- Let those <strong>fight in the cause of Allah</strong> <strong>Who sell the life</strong> of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah,- <strong>whether he is slain or gets victory (i.e. killed or be killed) -</strong> Soon shall We give him a <strong>reward of great (value).</strong> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Quran-4:95-</strong> Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the <strong>cause of Allah</strong> <strong>with their goods and their persons</strong>. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and <strong>fight with their goods and persons</strong> (sacrifice both life and wealth) than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Quran-3:169</strong><em>-</em><strong>:</strong> Think not of <strong>those who are slain in Allah's way as dead</strong>. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance <strong>in the presence of their Lord;</strong> <em>(Here Allah is saying that those jihadi who dies [commit suicide] is not dead but he will be living with Allah)</em>.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Now, I do not believe that anybody can have slightest doubt that the above clear invitations (from Allah) for the ardent fanatical believers can very easily convince the pious (pure) Muslims to become <strong>a time-bomb (suicidal)</strong> in order to kill infidels/kaffirs-for the cause of Allah! The above <strong>verses (9:111; 3:169; 4:74; 4:95)</strong> are clearly ordering devout Muslims <strong>"to kill and be killed"; </strong>that is, Allah is teaching Muslims to sacrifice their <strong>own lives (to commit suicide)</strong> in His cause (Allah's cause) in order to kill infidels (enemy of Allah). This single verse (9:111) very precisely <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">justifies suicide bombing</span></strong>-the most lethal, most terrifying, most inhuman and most successful weapon majority Islamic terrorists are using today to kill Allah's enemies. It is the perfect example (without any ambiguity) of suicidal method Allah has prescribed for devout Muslims. In the verse above (9:111) Islamic Allah clearly saying that: <strong><span style="font-weight: normal">He (Allah) purchased life and property of believers in exchange of lustful and unimaginable lucrative heavenly pleasures for those who will die (commit suicide) for the cause (killing kaffirs) of Allah.</span></strong> After this, Muslims (ardent followers of the Quran) do not need any more killing instructions for their motivation to kill kaffirs/infidels. For good reason we can sum up that the Islamic God (Allah) is the most dangerous deity having unlimited vengeful, cruel, intolerant, intimidating and war-loving blood thirsty divine entity. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">But this is not all!

<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana">Holy Quran, as we read, is full of heinous, inhuman, and utterly dreadful cruel verses.  The main themes of Quranic or scriptural instruction are: <strong>pursuance by advice, then by intimidation/coercion, then by force (killing, fighting, maiming etc), and in return plenty of heavenly reward from Allah.</strong>  We can find hundreds of cruel hateful and utterly inhuman verses throughout the Quran. The above Quranic scriptures incited early Muslim Jihadis of 7<sup>th</sup> century period to kill thousands of non-Muslims and other infidels. During the early period of Islam, especially during Islamic expeditions by Prophet Muhammad himself while he was in Medina, thousands of infidels were brutally killed (beheaded) by the Jihadis. These same Quranic verses may still inciting devout/fanatical Muslims of modern days. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Hadiths about holy Jihad and suicide:</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana">Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihad) was sanctioned widely in sahi hadiths, which can incite Islamic suicide terrorists. Almost one-third of the fourth of nine volumes of Bukhari, Islam's principal collector of Hadith, focused on jihad as physical war. The following are a few examples: </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana">Sahi Bukhari: Volume 4, Book 52, Number 53:</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana">Narrated Anas bin Malik: The Prophet said, "Nobody who dies and finds good from Allah (in the Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given the whole world and whatever is in it, <strong>except the martyr</strong> who, on seeing the superiority of martyrdom, would like to come back to the world and <strong>get killed again</strong> (in Allah's Cause)."  </font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-right: 36pt" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana"><em><span style="font-style: normal">Mishkat al-Masabih</span></em>, Vol. 1:814.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Al-Miqdam b. Madikarib reported God's messenger as saying, "The martyr receives six good things from God: he is forgiven at the first shedding of his blood, he is shown his abode in paradise, he is preserved from the punishment in the grave, he is kept safe from the greatest terror, he has placed on his head the crown of honour a ruby which is better than the world and what it contains, <strong>he is married to seventy-two wives of the maidens</strong> with large dark eyes, and is made intercessor for seventy of his relatives." Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted it.   </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana">Sahi Bukhari# 35, page-102:   </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana">Prophet Muhammad (sa) narrated, " He who is out at war Allah becomes the protector for him. Because, he only joins the fight when he put his solid belief upon Allah and his Apostle. Allah provides him wealth and much booty (<em>Maal-e-goni-mat) </em>with which he returns home. Or, place him in the paradise by making him a Shaheed (martyrdom). </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="articletext"><font face="Verdana">Sahi Bukhari: Volume 4, Book 52, Number 44:</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Narrated Abu Huraira: A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "Instruct me as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward)." He replied, "I do not find such a deed." Then he added, "Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break your fast?" The man said, "But who can do that?" Abu- Huraira added, "The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied in a long rope."  </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Now, does it take a rocket scientist to understand the source of the fanatical will of those September 11 terrorists?  Does it ring the bell from where these Islamic terrorists (all over the world) getting their inspiration and hope?  Will our Islamists still say, "Islam is a religion of peace," or that "Qur'an is full of kind and compassionate advises?"</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Purely and solely—the real motivation behind the suicide terrorism by the Islamic terrorists is the teachings of <strong>Qur'an and Sunnah </strong>(Prophetic traditions). Western politicians erroneously and perhaps ignorantly call it "radical Islam" or "evil or distorted ideology." This is absolutely wrong statement by the politically correct western politicians. That ideology is nothing but the ideology of pure Islam, which is the holy teaching of the Qur'an.  Therefore, Qur'an and Sunnah (prophetic instructions) are the true foundations of Islamic terrorism. Palestinian problems, wars of Iraq and Afghanistan etc. are only a plea to wage Islamic Jihad. Poverty or frustrations are not the cause of terrorism, because poverty and frustrations also exists amongst millions of poor people from other religions. Will any poor Christian, Hindu or a Buddhist bother to commit suicide to kill innocent Westerners? Absolutely not!</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Lives of any human are precious and human beings definitely love their own life more than anything in the world.  Nobody is ready to die or destroy his own life even for millions of dollars.  But a simple minded (otherwise a good man) but fanatically blind believer of religion Islam can eagerly give his life with a smile on his face. Why? Because he simply learned that if he dies for Islam, or killed others (infidels) for Islam—he will be given a sure suite in heavens of Allah, where he will enjoy plenty of hurries for unlimited sex, delicious foods forever and ever with no interruption, what so ever.  This may sound silly to me or to any intelligent human being. But, this is the one and only truth to a blind-faith believer (<em>Islamic Zombie</em>) of the so-called holy book Qur'an, indeed!  <strong>The Qur'an is</strong> <strong>the center of Jihadi inspiration</strong>.  [<em>Please read the article of Islamic heaven</em> <a href="file:///C:/bangla_article/mukto-mona/My%20Documents/Islamic%20Heaven2.doc" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single">HERE</a> <em>to learn why fanatics are dying for</em>]</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Litmus test of conversion: </strong>All religious belief systems work like the infectious viruses which I call "faith viruses"! However, these "faith viruses" have different characters too! Not all faith viruses are the same. Islamic virus is the most virulent and lethal of all the "faith viruses" in the world. Take this example: You have converted 40 westerners in "virus of faith" from various religions as follows: 10 in Islam; 10 in Christianity; 10 in Hindu; and 10 in Buddhism. Very easily, you can find that at least half of the 10 Muslim converts will turn into Islamic terrorists and suicide bombers. Because, converted Muslims are pure believers of Quran and Sunnah (Prophetic traditions) and they are Muslims by the book and more radicalized than those who are Muslims due to their birth in the Muslim parents. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Among the Islamic terrorists—at least several dozens of very active and deadly terrorists are from the converted Muslims around the world. Remember how many white converts from Europe came to Iraq and blasted suicide Islamic bombs to kill some people in the funeral processions? Remember—shoe bomber Richard Reid, American Taliban (John Walker Lindh), dirty bomber Jose Padilla, Zacaria Moussaoui, or Adam Ghadan of California white convert to Islam, who is now acting as the publicity in charge for al-Qeada in Pakistan? But amazingly, none of the converts from all other religions (except Islam) will never be a terrorist to blast suicide bomb or any bomb at all. Fanatic jihadi zeal and fervor is much more amongst the newly converted Muslims than Muslims by birth. Because, converted Muslims are the Muslims by the book (Quran and Hadiths) and they try to become pure Muslims by the code of the Islamic books. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Some evidences from the testimonies of Islamic terrorists:</strong>  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">All the Islamic terrorists arrested by police in Europe (especially in Netherlands such as Van Gogh killing) readily cited Quran as their teacher to commit terrorism in order to kill infidels. In Amsterdam, Netherlands—Mohammed Bouyeri, the killer of filmmaker Theo Van Gogh confessed his guilt and showed no remorse for his dastardly act of Islamic slaughter. During court trial he made following remarks:  <strong>"I don't feel your pain</strong>", he told the victim's mother. <strong>"Because I was driven by my religious conviction."</strong>   He also said, <strong>"If I were released and would have the chance to do it again…I would do exactly the same thing." </strong>At one point he said to the victim's mother, "<strong>I have to admit I don't have sympathy for you. I can't feel for you because I think you are a non-believer."</strong> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In the train terrorism incident at Madrid (Spain) the Islamic terrorists were all longtime resident of Spain (North American and Syrian born) who admitted to police that they were <strong>"inspired by the doctrines (Koran) of Islam"</strong> to rise up against their adopted host country to kill 191 Spanish innocent citizen.   </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">During 2005-2006, in Bangladesh (<em>a newly infested nation by Islamic jihadis</em>) has experienced an epidemic of bomb blasts by Islamic terrorists of Bangladeshi variety including scores of suicide bombings to kill judges in the various court premises.  In such process of suicide bombing attempts, two have been captured by the police. When asked by the reporters why they were going to kill people by <u>suicide method</u>, they have answered: <strong>"We were doing it by the order of Quranic instructions by Allah". </strong> When Bangladesh terrorist leader Maulana Shaikh Rahman and Bangla Bhai have been captured by the police, Maulana Shaikh Rahman said: <strong>"We have done it to establish Allah's laws in Bangladesh and we were doing it according to the Quran."</strong> Showing one copy of Quran in his hand, he (Maulana) said: <strong>"If I am a terrorist, then Quran also a terrorist"</strong>. <strong>What could be the more clear evidence that Islamic terrorists are directly getting incitement and encouragement from the holy Quran?</strong> </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">In America, the 20<sup>th</sup> hijacker of 9/11 terrorism Zacaria Moussaoui proudly declared in the court: <strong>"I wish I could kill more Americans, because my religion Islam (which is of course Quran) demands that I kill infidels.</strong>"  Zacaria Moussaoui or any other Islamic terrorists never told that they have been incited to do terrorism by their poverty or political oppressions alone. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Some arguments used by Islamists to fool the west, and also western Politically Correct (PC) leaders fraudulently try to justify Islamic suicide terrorism as follows:</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Does Islam prohibit suicide bombing? </strong></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">It's a greatest lie to say that Qur'an prohibits committing suicide! Quran only prohibits taking one's life for no holy purpose.That is the suicide (Qur'an referring) to kill one-self only out of frustrations and for no good reason. But to die (to kill the kaffirs or enemy of Islam) for the cause of Islam is mandatory good deeds for the believers, which has been directed more than 100 times in the Holy Quran with plenty of rewards. Quranic verse 9:111 is the testament of committing suicide bombing. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Are all the suicide bombings same?</strong>  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islamic apologists often argue that suicide bombings for the cause of freedom fighting committed not only by the Muslims, but by many other nations (Tamil, Jews, and Japanese Kamakazies) committed suicide bombings for their own freedom struggle. According to them, Muslims are committing suicide today for their freedom struggle. Therefore, suicide bombings by Muslim youths have nothing to do with Islam! Most prudent question can be asked here: <strong>Are all those past suicide bombings same as Islamic suicide bombings today? Are their pattern same? Let us examine:   </strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Those so called Tamil Tiger, Jews or Japanese Kamakazis may have used technique of suicide bombings very rarely as their desperate quest only to free their own motherland, and their suicide acts were absolutely limited to their own land targeting soldiers, leaders and not innocent civilians. Tamil, Jews, Kamakazies or IRA never blasted bombs in other countries outside their own geographic boundary; they only primarily did blast bombs within their own border. Rarely, isolated single bomb in the vicinity of their border, such as Tamil's killing Razib Ghandi for his support of Sri Lankan Government. But they never ever came to America, Britain, Spain, Indonesia, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, Saudi Arabia etc. to blast suicide bombs inside restaurants, bus, train, metro, ocean beaches, tourist resorts etc. None of those above did suicide bombings throughout the whole world globally like those Islamists vigorously doing it today.  How many Tamil blasted suicide bomb in Europe or America?  Was there any global jihadi phenomenon of suicide bombings by Tamil Tigers like those Islamists? </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Profile of the Islamic Terrorists</strong>:</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Osama Bin Laden (OBL) and his al-Qaeda jihadis have frequently cited many passages from the Holy Quran to justify their flagrant acts of terrorism around the world. Suicide bombing is the most successful weapon to strike terror in the hearts of the western infidels. In his famous 'fatwa' of declared war against Americans in 1998, terrorist leader OBL has repeatedly used jihadi verses from the Quran (mentioned in this essay) to incite his followers to kill Americans/infidels primarily by the act of suicide bombing. All the 9/11 Islamic terrorists left their private notes (especially Muhammad Ata) citing Quranic killing verses and they <strong>all committed suicide to kill American infidels (Kaffirs) 100% according to the Quranic verss-9:111. </strong>Not a single time they have ever claimed or mentioned any other inciting agent for their killing spree. Israel have had captured numerous would be suicide bombers (who's detonating did not work in their attempt of suicide bombing) with the suicide belt around them, and they all were interviewed by the western reporters in the Israeli prison cell.  All most all of them told the reporters-they wanted to die to kill infidels according to the Quranic instructions to achieve heavenly pleasures with 72 virgin houris [<em>Please read the hyperlink article on Islamic heaven</em>]. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Nobody wants to die because of poverty or for money!</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Point to ponder that life is invaluable and extremely precious to every human (Rich, poor, young, old, sick or even handicapped) and no one wants to die in vain without any real purpose or gains. Only a superior/divine lustful hopes and inspiration due to brainwashing can trigger somebody to take his/her life. Islamic terrorists are definitely inspired by such lustful afterlife. Palestinian young boys and girls of 12-16 <u>do not die</u> just for revenge or to free their motherland. They definitely have the vision of Islamic heavenly pleasures (due to brainwashing) which inspire them to wear a deadly suicide belt around their young and tender bodies, only to give their life in order to kill the enemy of Islam. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Social injustice and poverty! </strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Some moderate or so called moderate Muslims, some leftists, and also some ignorant non-Muslims and politically correct (PC) westerners often try to give reasons for Islamic terrorism. These people do not believe that the religion of Islam has anything to do with the today's Islamic terrorists' mayhem. They bring some ridiculous theory such as poverty, illiteracies, social injustice and oppressions by the majorities (in non-Muslim majority nations like India and all western nations in which Muslims are minority and immigrants) are the main causes of Islamic terrorism. Poverty, social injustice or illiteracies are not the problem of only Muslims. In many South Asian and African nations there are also millions of non-Muslims who are also illiterate, desperately poor, socially oppressed etc. etc.; but how many of them do suicide terrorism? Why none of the non-muslim immigrants in the western nations never have problems like Muslim immigrants, never have to commit suicide or any form of terrorism? Who can answer these questions? These folks also try to bring Palestine-Israeli or Kashmiri problems to justify Islamic terrorism; as if, Palestine-Israeli and Kashmir problems are very newly started. Both of these problems (Palestine and Kashmir) have started almost 70 years back but the world never saw such madness of Islamic jihadi terrorism until Osam bin-Laden's jihad has started in 1998 right after the victory of Afghan Mujahideen over the Russian infidels. I hope nobody can deny this truth!</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Iraq and Afghanistan war!</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islamists also now telling us that those Muslim youths blasting their jihadi suicide bombs only to take revenge for Iraq war. As if, before Iraq war Islamic jihadis were very sober, gentle and were sitting idle.  May I ask why those Islamic jihadis were blasting bombs relentlessly at US military camps in Saudi Arabia , American Embassies in Tanzania , Uganda , Pakistan , Nairobi and elsewhere, much before Iraq war?  Why they killed more than 3000 innocent civilians in WTC? Why they bombed US ship at Yemen?  Why they bombed US barrack at Beirut?  Was their Iraq war then?  </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">However, the zeal of Islamic fanaticism could have energized by the Middle East Political situation of Palestine and Israel. But this has also much to do with their inherent hatred towards Jews and other non-Muslims which they have acquired <u>primarily</u> from the teachings of Quran and some supports from hadiths in the Madrassas in their early lives.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Osama bin Laden is the true Muslim who follows Quran and hadiths in 'Toto' and this hero of Muslim interprets Quranic verses and hadiths as per the needs of Islamic Umma, and of course, as per the real spirit of medieval Islam. In fact, gullible Muslims consider OBL as the mirror image of Prophet Muhammad and many things about him (OBL) are 100% compatible with the life and deeds of Islamic prophet Muhammad. That is why true Muslims (Maulanas, Mullahs, Madrassa students [Talibans], all leaders of Islamic political parties) of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and other Muslim countries are supporting Osama and his host, Talibans of Afghanistan. It's totally irrelevant and useless to claim that Osama, al-Qaeda terrorists and Talibans are not true Muslims, or they are Muslims by their distorted views of Islam! Actually, <strong><u>they are the real Muslims</u></strong>, and they are <strong><u>the Muslims by the book</u></strong>. All others so called progressive Muslims (living in the western comfort) are simply Muslims <strong><u>by virtue of their birth in a Muslim family</u></strong>. These so called moderate Muslims are either ignorant about real Islam, or they are deceiving westerners by their cunning lies. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>FP</strong>: There is a serious issue in terms of Muslims (pious Muslims obviously) not integrating into their own Western societies. What is happening here? What should western nations know about this problem?</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Mirza:</strong> Islam is a cultic (brotherhood or ummatic) religion by nature. The very theme of Islam is: <strong>Allah is the sole creator of everything on heaven and Earth and Muslims are His only legitimate and righteous people.</strong> Remaining all other people (Jews, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, etc. etc.) are simply infidels and hated by Allah. Therefore, true belief-system in Islam strictly prohibits any integration with non-muslims. Holy Quran clearly dictates Muslims not to mix with infidels at all. Quran asks all Muslims to hate all non-Muslims. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Clash of immigrants with the host: </strong>In the year 2001, there were riots in London streets between the immigrant British citizens and the host Britons. Surprisingly those immigrant British citizens were none other than the <strong>Muslim immigrants</strong> (mainly Pakistani and Bangladeshi descent). Britain has the immigrants from various countries and various religions. Most immigrants except Muslim immigrants are usually blending themselves with the social fabrics of the host countries, and they learn to adapt with the host country's life style slowly and steadily. But Muslim immigrants always try to isolate themselves and never try to blend with the social fabrics of their host nations. In 2006, Paris was burning for a week because of Islamic Ghetto in the Paris suburb. This is the same identical story of Muslim immigrants everywhere in the whole world. Question is why? Below are some fundamental causes which should answer the above question: </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Brotherhood in Islam:</strong> Islam is the only religion having brotherhood or Ummatic provision. One Muslim is considered brother of only another Muslim. A Muslim can not be a brother of Hindu, Christian or Jews or infidels. Nor any non-muslims could be brother of any Muslim. Muslims are forbidden <u>even to pray</u> for any dead infidels. [<em>Quran:9:84:</em> <em>"And never (O Muhammad) pray for one of them who dieth, nor stand by his grave. Lo! they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and they died while they were evil-doers."]
<p> </em></font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">In fact, there is a mandatory supplication (condemning and asking Allah to give hellish life in the afterlife of all non-muslims who is dead) for devout Muslims to recite the moment he/she hears any news of the death of any non-muslim. But, when any Muslim hear the news of the death of a Muslim—he/she should recite a supplication which is asking Allah to reward heaven for the dead muslim. This is the exact mindset of any devoutly practicing Muslim but they will lie 100% in the so called inter-faith meeting.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong><u>Allah's instruction for Islamic Brotherhood: </u></strong><em>Quran-49:10-"The believers are but a single Brotherhood: So make peace and reconciliation between your two (contending) brothers; And fear God, that ye May receive Mercy"</em> (Yousuf Ali's Translation). </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">In his Shan-e-nuzul (exegesis), Maulana Yousuf Ali stated:  "The enforcement of the Muslim brotherhood is the greatest social ideal of Islam. On it was based the Prophet's Sermon at his last pilgrimage, and Islam cannot be completely realized until this is achieved." Therefore, Islam is like <strong>a large-scale religious cult</strong> which does not recognize any other religion as pure religion. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Religious superiority barriers</strong>: True Muslims consider themselves the most superior human and they are bound to hate all non-Muslims. As per the Quranic teachings, Muslims always consider <strong>western life-style most immoral, unclean, and unethical</strong> and they can not emulate western life style for simple belief in Islam. According to their belief, it is the westerners (Hosts) should be emulating Islamic life styles which are highly superior, moral and Islamic. Anything un-Islamic should be discarded or condemn by any true Muslims. The following religious mandatory rules should explain more clearly why Muslim immigrants are unable to integrate. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Muslims are not allowed to convert: </strong>Muslims can not change or convert to other religions at all. Quran prohibits any conversion of Muslim to another religion. An apostate (converted Muslim or ex-muslims) is to die as per Quran. (Quran-4:89: "<em>They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, <strong>seize them and slay them </strong>wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks;-)" </em>How silly is it that Islamists are fooling westerners by the joke of inter-faith congregations?   
<p> </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Dress code and food restrictions:  </strong>Islam has a special dress code for both men and women?  Islam is nothing but Arab nationalism in the disguise of religion. Anybody from any foreign land convert to Islam also needs to adapt/change his name, dress and cultural habits, which is nothing but Arab national dress and Arab culture. A devout Bangladeshi, Chinese or a Burmese convert to Islam will pretend to be a good Muslim by wearing Arab garb or hijab for women, even though his/her own national dress is not at all similar to Arab national dress. Muslims also follow very strict food codes. Unlike other religious groups, Muslims can not eat western most hygienically produced meat products. Muslims need to eat so called Halal meat, un-hygienically produced by Islamic primitive rules. <strong>Pork and alcohols</strong> are strictly prohibited for Muslims. Convert Muslims even need to learn Arabic for daily rituals of Islam. They are not allowed to pray in their own mother tongue. Result is they do not know what they are praying. But unlike Muslim convert, Hindu, Christian or Jewish converts do not need to forsake their own names, national dress code or language of praying. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Problems on the job: </strong>Muslim immigrants also face tremendous challenge in their job situations and end-up frequently in court battles with the employers—because their exceptional demands: five time prayer times, hijab/Nikab/Burkha wearing, and many other strict religious rituals etc. World should already know how many such court battles happened in Britain, USA and many other western host nations mostly with Muslim immigrants. Americans should not forget about those Ethiopian cab drivers (who refused to carry western kaffirs carrying alcohols with them) and those Ethiopian workers in the meat-packing company in California who demanded 30 minutes paid time for each of their 5 times Islamic rituals daily.  </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Political misfit</strong>: Islam does not like western democracy at all. Democracy is highly incompatible with Islam. Out of sixty some Muslim majority nations—not a single Muslim nation has stable democracy at all. Hence, every immigrant Muslim would like to have Islamic Shariaat or hudud laws (Allah's law) established in their host nations too! Islam does not have the theological basis for change and integrate with non-Muslim life-style. Secularism is strictly forbidden. Innovation ("bida") is strictly forbidden. Muhammed was the Seal of the Prophets -- his word is final. Itjihad is (now) forbidden. Islam was set up as a political state with numerous complexes, detailed temporal laws, not just a few general spiritual guidelines (as is the case with Christianity). No theological basis for change. No theological basis for change. And thus no theological "bridge" to allow Muslims to get out from the 7<sup>th</sup> century life style of early Islam to the life style of modern world.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Problem of Inter-faith marriage: </strong>Islam does not<strong> </strong>allow inter-faith marriage, period. Muslim girl can never marry a non-muslim man; but Muslim man can marry a non-muslim girl, provided the bride immediately converted to Islam and take a muslim name. This is a tremendous social barrier for the integration of Muslims in the host nation, which sometimes end-up with great tragedy like "honor killing" and other family problems. Of course, this may not be any problem for those not so good Muslims or somewhat modernized Muslim immigrants, who are a rare variety. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><font face="Verdana">Some examples will help to understand Islamic mindsets:</font></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Immigrants Muslims established Islamic Sharia laws in Canada; they are working hard to have it in U.K. and also working clandestinely but steadily to have "Islamic Sharia laws"  in the USA. Islamists are working hard to establish Islamic economy (Sharia economy) in USA (Report by Mr. Frank Gaffney). Muslims can not easily blend-in with the host nations of any western country, in general. They can't get along with Christians in Nigeria and Sudan. They can't get along with Eastern Orthodox in Eastern Europe. They can't get along with Hindus and Buddhists in Malaysia. They can't get along with Hindus in the Sub-Continent. They can't get along with Buddhists in Thailand and Burma. They can't get along with Catholics in the Philippines. They can not get along with majority Chinese in mainland China. They can not get along with majority Russian (Muslims in Chechnya) in Russia. They can't get along with Jews in the Middle East. They can't get along with Coptic Christians in Egypt. They can't get along with Christians in Indonesia. They can't get along with Ba'hai in Iran. Shia and Sunni can't get along with each other very well in Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bahrain, etc.   Islamic deceptions, inter-faith and confusions: The so called "Inter-faith meetings and congregations" are Islamic deception—invented only after 9/11, to avoid repercussions or hate-crimes against Muslim immigrants. Please consider the fallacy of their motive and dishonesty. Allah even forbade them (Quran-9:84) to pray for any dead non-Muslims! Here they are playing 'cheating-art technique' of Islamic tolerance with living non-Muslims! What a dreadful mockery and deception of inter-faith meeting!   These real Muslims are actually following the footsteps of Prophet Muhammad. Prophet of Islam did exactly the same in 7th century period, when he came to Medina after having clash with the Majority Pagans at Mecca. He also tried to fool all the affluent Jewish tribes in Medina and nearby area in the name of peace-pact with them, only to buy times, in order to gather his supports from all those poor vagabond Bedouins, luring them with booty (spoils of wars) and then after gathering enough strength attacked those affluent Jewish tribes with full force. Within 10 years, Prophet of Islam killed all men or driven them all out of Arabia and enslaved women and children (Islamic booty) after occupying all their lands and wealth. This is the same technique today's Muslim immigrants try to follow in their land of immigrations. In reality, true muslims can not respect or tolerate any other faith or non-believers. But they will show their false tolerance and respect to others, as long as, Muslims remain small minority in the host nations.   Western host nations will fail to understand true character of Muslims and most readers will get hard time to believe what I am writing here. Only ex-muslims like me can tell for sure about the hidden plan and mindsets of Islamists. Because, Muslims in general will lie about the real problem why they can not blend with the western host nations. Especially, groups (A and B) will lie and fool the westerners and they will try to put blame on the host nations. They will try to fool the host nations by their ridiculous so called "inter-faith" nonsense, as long as, Muslims will remain small minority. The moment Muslims will grow at least 5-10% of the host country, they will expose their real face of Islam. All most everywhere in the world, any non-muslim country having at least 5-10% Muslim population—are riddled with political battles or on going separatist conflict, putting the lives of millions in political quagmire.   Now, any western reporters try to verify this truth by talking with some not so good or so called moderate Muslims (Muslims by birth only having no or little knowledge about Quarn or real Islam; or know the truth but hiding as part of their deceptive Islamic technique) will be utterly fooled by their unqualified, unscrupulous or dishonest opinions and comments about Islam. These Muslims will simply deny everything I am writing in this interview. Westerners must learn from the reality of fact: Muslim immigrants are always problematic to any host nation, period. It will be much better for the western host nations if they carefully evaluate the very religious factor which controls the social behavior of most Muslim immigrants. They must not forget that—no other immigrants but Muslims are in problem in the western host nations.</font>    </p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>FP:</strong> How must the West combat Islamic terrorism successfully? If we fail, what is going to happen to the civilized world?</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Mirza: </strong> Yes, Islamic terrorism could be stopped if the entire west be united and take the right measures. West must not weigh Islamic terrorism so lightly. This is more dangerous and deadlier phenomenon than communism. It took fifty years to defeat communism. But it may take only twenty years to subdue this Islamic terrorism, if the West takes the right course. But the menace may continue to grow if the west follows the fruitless policy of appeasing the Muslims, disseminating patronizing statements like: <strong>"Terrorists are not real Muslims, Islam is a religion of peace, Terrorists are radicalized or perverted interpretation of peaceful Islam etc.</strong>" Western appeasement will be dangerous and this foolish technique of appeasing Islamists will only embolden the fanatic zeal of Islamists. Please remember, Muslims do believe strongly that—Allah is working behind their ulterior plan of converting entire earth under the fold of Islam, they call it PEACE or SURRENDER!</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Islamic terrorists <u>are not</u> misinterpreting Islam; rather they are interpreting Islam very correctly. <strong>Islam is like cancer and Qur'an is th</strong>e <strong>carcinogen, which causes cancer.</strong>  <strong>We must know our enemy.</strong> We must fight the cause and not the symptoms. Unless scientists can subdue the HIV virus, the cause of AIDS, scientists can never control AIDS. To defeat Islamic terrorism west must learn about the true cause of Islamic terrorism! </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Spending billions of dollars in strong security or democratization tactics will not help. Sweet appeasing talks also will do no good. Almost 80% of world Muslims does support Osama's ideology in their hearts. They only talk false sympathy in front of westerners to please western govt. But when inside their house, they sympathize with those suicide bombers very much. In every suicide bombings when Western cities are in chaos, peoples die, and Western economy is in shambles—most Muslims all over the world gloat in their hearts. No doubt about it. Some even comments: Allah punished America or Israel etc. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">The West must remember that up until now—no Islamic government, or any famous Islamic Imams or Mullahs have ever issued fatwa condemning Osama's barrage of suicide bombings. World have not seen any overwhelming major street demonstrations against any suicide terrorists anywhere. World must not forget what kind of mayhem (street demonstrations, burning buildings, killings etc) was created by Muslims worldwide just for a few Danish cartoons about Prophet Muhammad. Just for writing a controversial novel Salman Rushdie was sentenced to death. As of now no Muslim country sentenced Osama to death. We must ask ourselves why?  </font></p>

The West (Europe and America) must be united and declare war against Islamists. American President (along with full support from all western head of states) must issue personal letters to all government heads of Muslim world to cooperate, or face economic embargo. The West must ask all Muslim Governments to cooperate honestly, sincerely and actively by issuing fatwa's against terrorists. It's not enough to say, "We despise terrorism", but must act to stop this madness by strongly disassociating with the Islamists, isolating them, arresting them, and imprisoning them without any mercy. All   Governments of the Muslim world must impose a total and strict ban on all Madrashas (religious schools-breeding ground of terrorists) and terrorist organization formed by Islamic mullahs. </font></p>

They must wear their dress as per their own national standard only, and never should do practice these silly appeasement of wearing Muslim women's dress, while visiting any foreign Islamic nation. This appeasement only tells that western women dress is much inferior than the dress wore by Muslim women. Islamists take this as the weakness of the western civilization and gloat inside by considering the notion that—Islamic women's dress-codes are much superior and ethical. </font></p>

Oil money is the supreme blood-line nourishing and invigorating this Islamic menace. Before the influx of these petro-dollars in the middle-east, Islamic "jihadi utopia" was having deep sleep for more than thousand years. By importing Middle-Eastern oil—west has simply awakened this "Genie of Islamic monster" which has become an ultimate threat to the survival of our civilization. Saudi Kingdom should be accounted for all it's apartheid treatments to other religions and should face questions: why they have been spreading vicious militant Islamic ideology throughout the entire world, on the other hand, why they have strictly forbidden practice of any other religion in their Kingdom? Unless, west stops importing oil from middle-East, it will be almost impossible to defeat this Islamic menace! </span></font></p>

All hateful preaching in the Mosques must be strictly banned. Just a few hundreds yards from Whit House, the Saudi Islamic school in Virginia is openly teaching their young students all those Quranic hateful verses. It is a great shame that, up until now, American authority utterly failed to ban these terrorists' dictums from the Saudi School curriculum. Western intelligence must not overlook <strong>'Mosques-Islamic centers-Madrashas'</strong> connections to almost 100% of the Islamic terrorists killed and arrested during their operation. If those <strong>'Mosques-Islamic centers-Madrashas' </strong>are the so-called<strong> radicalized Islam then what is the real Islam? </strong>Terrorists like Osama bin Laden and others are the victims of Qur'anic scriptural teachings. Devout Muslims swallow these hateful Qur'anic teachings every day (<em>five times</em>) so passionately only to become brainwashed in the Mosques and Islamic centers (Breeding grounds) for committing suicide bombings in the midst of innocent gatherings. </span></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><strong>Conclusion</strong></font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Verdana">Islamic terrorism is the giant problem of entire mankind today and fanatic Muslims are the zombies at the hands of immoral Quranic teachings<strong>. </strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">How can one</span></strong><strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">cure a body by keeping the cancerous lesion inside the body?</span></strong> Time has arrived to identify the real enemy of the western civilization. Nothing can change this precarious situation of Muslims unless we realize the real problem (<strong><span style="font-weight: normal">read Quran</span></strong>) and take care of it. It's true that all Muslims are not terrorists, but all terrorists are pure Muslims as per the Qur'an.    Poisonous tonic will cause poisonous effect whoever drinks it. Should we not analyze the tonic to determine the harmful ingredients, which causes the poisonous effects? Or should we start blaming those drinkers (instead of the tonic) for the ill effect of the tonic? </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">I am positive, within 15/20 years of proper western cumulative actions—this madness by Islamic suicide bombers will be evaporated for good. If we fail to take positive actions narrated above—our civilization will perish. Killing some terrorists, arresting and killing Osama bin Laden or spending billions of dollars to establish democracy in the Middle East will solve nothing. Because, to solve the terrorist problem, we must destroy the ultimate machine (Quran and Islam), which do create terrorists. Let me finish my comments by quoting this very important saying:  <strong><em>"It would be naïve to ignore in Islam a deep thread of intolerance toward unbelievers."</em>—</strong>Andrew Sullivan.</font></p>
