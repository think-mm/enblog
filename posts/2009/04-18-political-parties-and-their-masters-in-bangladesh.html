The country does not have the resources to employ the required personnel in all its service sectors. And the government does not have the financial ability to give the required logistical supports to these understaffed organizations. The level of poverty prevailing among the common people is in such a state that any foreign visitor may feel sick to see the number of beggars begging in the city and the shelter less people sleeping in railway sheds and open roads. Definitely he is fortunate that he cannot know the distress of the rural people who are shy enough to disclose their hunger or inadequacies. In extreme sickness they however visit the hospital and the foreigner should be invited to see the state of such hospitals only to witness what duty the elected government of a democratic government play in this land. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-CA">The government however, has maintained one traditional system. In Bangladesh the less-intelligent people unaware of their resources produce many children and become poor. Then they send their children to rich men's houses to work as maids and servants. The government has not only accepted this "poor men's' policy" to such extent that considerable portion of the country's valuable foreign currency are earned by them. The state of helplessness of the government to learn that the foreign countries can no more keep such people in employment because of recession indicates the government's dependence on their earning. And it is not a story that the government of such a poor country import costly luxury items from abroad and quite often declare tax holiday, bailout program, tax remission, subsides etc. for the rich people, businessmen and industrialists. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"> </p>

Details of such this 'never heard before' program are not yet clearly understood. But there are indications that the program would involve ever-increasing dependence on electronic gadgets and accessories, none of which are produced in this country. It is not still known who would supply the 'big sum' for this mysterious project and how. "Digital Bangladesh" would not only use up large sum for establishment and maintenance, but it would open up wide canal for draining out people's hard-earned money. "How ?" </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial;" lang="EN-CA">It has now been known that the development of digital communication would ensure 'internet facilities' every sphere, even in the elementary schools. Experienced people know that it makes the intra-country transfer of money easier. At present millions of young men and women enjoy considerable time of their internet-time in viewing "adult site entertainments". Many English medium school going children and most of the university students residing in hostels have mastered the 'subject". Not only that, many of them have helped those authorities (I am not aware, whether they did it voluntarily or for money) in preparing data base (photograph and statistics) of local girls. Anybody having little doubt in this statement should first check by himself and then comment. I do not know if our government knows anything about it, or the thought of giving good businesses to certain businessmen has taught them 'not to see'. The internet authorities have made such viewing extremely cheap for obvious reason. With it however, the foreign authorities offer to show "much more interesting materials" in exchange of bigger amount of money. Since money transfer facilities by ATM or other cards are not still everywhere, this one way business has not yet flourished. It is expected that the government would soon make such transfer easier. With that the money earned by a peasant by sweat and blood from the paddy field and given to his son for education would find no problem to travel abroad for "adult entertainment materials". It is not known how much money the country would earn from the "Digital Bangladesh" project, but there are indications that after 'internet communication' and ATM facilities are ensured everywhere, some foreign people would be successful in squeezing out money from all corners of this country. In case the county intends to ensure an opposite stream, then the country would have to produce even more interesting adult programs. </span></p>

Their plans, programs and activities determine how the country and the people would be in the coming days. The government is elected on the basis of the vote of the majority of the people. This 'majority' in Bangladesh are the poor people. Hence, by all considerations this vast number of poor people should be considered as "masters" by the political party in the government. But the way the government endeavours to please the rich businessmen indicate, as if these rich men are the masters. Does it indicate that the political parties accept large sum of money from such businessmen ? </span></p>

Because of the attraction of this wealth bandits, vagabond and businessmen used to flock to this land from distant places. The old men might still remember the medicine and fruit-traders from Afghanistan or scissors and lock-knife traders from Iran to come to this land for obvious reasons. </span></p>

And the reason was simple. Take a sample land of say 1 kilometre by 1 kilometre area. Excepting the red hillocks of Comilla, every square feet of land, hill or water body of this land had (and<span> </span>still has) got the potentiality of producing vegetable or animal protein, fruits, medicine, pearl etc. On the other hand, take a similar patch of land anywhere in India. What you may find there might have been, boulders, infertile land of red soil, sandy desert etc. with sparse growth of thorny bush or trees. With the rounding of a year with six seasons, in Bengal the land bestowed the blessings of vegetables, fish, meat, fruit, fuel-wood and so on. Of course the stream of blessing at times was disrupted due to natural calamities. After the liberation of India a considerable quantity achieved production potentiality because of irrigation facilities by dams, canals and aqua-ducts. Similar steps were taken in case of the land of Bengal also, resulting in more yields. But in spite of all these, the country became poor and poorer. The West Pakistani government took away considerable quantity of wealth from this land. By that consideration they acted as an enemy. However, their political attitude, due to which millions of Hindus left this country for neighbouring India acted as a blessing, because it lessened population. </span></p>

Those who realize this fact are the well wishers of this country. Also those who tend to disagree by saying "educated men in excessive number are great wealth" are in fact<span> </span>patrons of this enemy.

A part of such amount transferred abroad has been brought to light. Now it is not hard to guess that the political parties that collect money from the large businessmen have to show proper honour, allegiance and obedience to the 'donors'.
