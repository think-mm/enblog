</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In the past, many internet readers might have enjoyed reading my article on <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com/Articles/skm/islamic_heaven171105.html">Islamic heaven</a> (having most glittering, most glamorous, most luxurious and most amazingly lustful provisions for afterlife) which I had posted (for both Muslims and non-Muslim folks) in the various internet forums including Muktomona site. My article on Islamic heaven was prepared very meticulously with all the available heavenly goodies (glad tidings) to be enjoyed by those pious <em>mumeen musalmans</em> in their afterlife. Here comes the 'Islamic Hell' with all the appropriate cautions from our most Merciful, most Compassionate, most Beneficent and most Powerful Pagan Allah (SWT). Please read them with extreme cautions and try to understand them very carefully, least you do not want to lose the most glittering Islamic heaven (Merciful Allah has prepared for you) and fall into the trap of 'Islamic hell' only to suffer unlimited pain and agony in your entire afterlife. </span></p>
<p align="justify">Â </p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://www.unholylegacy.woerlee.org/images/hell-islam.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Holy Quran is replete with verses having profoundly dreadful hellish-prescriptions formulated by the Merciful Allah to punish all the non-Muslims infidels including Jews and Christians. In this essay, I have presented some <strong>selected Quranic verses</strong> from the translation of Maolana Abdullah Yusuf Ali. Readers will find many identical hellish prescriptions of torture but they are in different chapters and verses altogether, hence should not be confused as the repetition of the same verse again and again. Below are some Quranic gems for hell <strong>punishment of kaffirs</strong>: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-43: 74-77)- The sinners will be in the Punishment of Hell, to dwell therein (for aye): Nowise will the (Punishment) be lightened for them, and in despair will they be there overwhelmed. Nowise shall We be unjust to them: but it is they who have been unjust themselves. They will cry: "O Malik! (chief gate-keeper of hell), would that thy Lord put an end to us!" He will say, "Nay, but ye shall abide!" </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-55:41-44)- The sinners will be known by their marks; and they will be seized by their forelocks and their feet. This is the Hell which the Sinners deny! In its midst and in the midst of boiling hot water will they wander round! Then which of the favours of your Lord will ye deny? </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-44:40)- Verily the Day of sorting out is the time appointed for all of them. The Day when no protector can avail his client in aught, and no help can they receive,
except such as receive Allah's Mercy; for He is Exalted in Might, Most Merciful. Verily the tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the Sinful, Like molten brass; it will boil in their insides. (A voice will cry: "Seize ye him and drag him into the midst of the Blazing Fire! "Then pour over his head the Penalty of Boiling Water, "Taste thou (this) Truly illustrious and honorable man! "Truly this is what ye used to doubt!" </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-77: 28-37): Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! (It will be said:) "Depart ye to that which ye used to reject as false! "Depart ye to a Shadow (of smoke ascending) in three columns, "(Which yields) no shade of coolness, and is of no use against the fierce Blaze. "Indeed it throws about sparks (huge) as Forts, "As if there were (a string of) yellow camels (marching swiftly)." Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! That will be a Day when they shall not be able to speak. Nor will it be open to them to put forth pleas. Ah woe, that Day, to the Rejecters of Truth! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-56: 51-56): "Then will ye truly, O ye that go wrong, and treat (Truth) as Falsehood! "Ye will surely taste of the Tree of Zaqqum. "Then will ye fill your insides therewith, : "And drink Boiling Water on top of it: "Indeed ye shall drink like diseased camels raging with thirst!" Such will be their entertainment on the Day of Requital! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-69: 30-37): (The stern command will say): "Seize ye him, and bind ye him, "And burn ye him in the Blazing Fire. "Further, make him march in a chain, whereof the length is seventy cubits! "This was he that would not believe in Allah Most High. "And would not encourage the feeding of the indigent! "So no friend hath he here this Day. "Nor hath he any food except the pus from the washing of wounds, "Which none do eat but those in sin." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-4: 55-56): Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him. And enough is Hell for a burning fire. And of them were (some) who believed therein and of them were (some) who turned away from it. Hell is sufficient for (their) burning. Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire: as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty; for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-76:3-4): We showed him the Way: whether he be grateful or ungrateful (rests on his will). For the Rejecters we have prepared chains, yokes, and a blazing Fire. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-73: 11-13): And leave Me (alone to deal with) those in possession of the good things of life (rich folks), who (yet) deny the Truth; and bear with them for a little while.
With Us are Fetters (to bind them), and a blazing Fire (to burn them), And a Food that chokes, and a Penalty Grievous. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-13:5)- Behold, verily in these things there are signs for those who understand! If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: "When we are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-80: 39-42)- Laughing, rejoicing. And other faces that Day will be dust-stained, Blackness will cover them: Such will be the Rejecters of Allah, the wicked.
(Quran-98: 6)- Those who reject (Truth), among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists, will be in Hell-Fire, to dwell therein (for aye). They are the worst of creatures. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-22: 19-22)- These two antagonists dispute with each other about their Lord; But those who deny (their Lord), for them will be cut out a garment of Fire over their heads will be poured out boiling water. With it will be scalded what is within their bodies, as well as (their) skins. In addition there will be maces (Clubs/whips) of iron (to punish) them. Every time they wish to get away therefrom, from anguish, they will be forced back therein, and (it will be said), "Taste ye the Penalty of Burning!" </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-8:73)- The Unbelievers are protectors, one of another: Unless ye do this, (protect each other), there would be tumult and oppression on earth, and great mischief. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-52:1-16) :By the Mount (of Revelation); By a Decree inscribed In a Scroll unfolded; By the much-frequented Fane; By the Canopy Raised High; And by the Ocean filled with Swell; Verily, the Doom of thy Lord will indeed come to pass; There is none can avert it;- On the Day when the firmament will be in dreadful commotion.
And the mountains will fly hither and thither. Then woe that Day to those that treat (Truth) as Falsehood;- That play (and paddle) in shallow trifles. That Day shall they be thrust down to the Fire of Hell, irresistibly. "This:, it will be said, "Is the Fire,- which ye were wont to deny! "Is this then a fake, or is it ye that do not see? "Burn ye therein: the same is it to you whether ye bear it with patience, or not: Ye but receive the recompense of your (own) deeds." </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-13:12-13): It is He Who doth show you the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope. It is He Who doth raise up the clouds, heavy with (fertilising) rain!
Nay, thunder repeateth His praises, and so do the angels, with awe. He flingeth the loud-voiced thunder-bolts, and therewith He striketh whomsoever He will, yet these (are the men) who (dare to) dispute about Allah, with the strength of His power (supreme)! </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-70: 14-17): And all, all that is on earth,- so it could deliver him, By no means! for it would be the Fire of Hell! Plucking out (his being) right to the skull!
Inviting (all) such as turn their backs and turn away their faces (from thee). </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-5:10)- Those who reject faith and deny our signs will be companions of Hell-fire.
(Quran-70: 38-40): Does every man of them long to enter the Garden of Bliss? By no means! For We have created them out of the (base matter) they know!
Now I do call to witness the Lord of all points in the East and the West that We can certainly. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-9: 84)- Nor do thou ever pray for any of them that dies, nor stand at his grave; for they rejected Allah and His Messenger, and died in a state of perverse rebellion. Let neither their wealth nor their (following in) sons dazzle thee: Allah's plan is to punish them with these things in this world, and that their souls may perish in their (very) denial of Allah. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-4: 13-14): Those are limits set by Allah; those who obey Allah and His Messenger will be admitted to Gardens with rivers flowing beneath, to abide therein (for ever) and that will be the supreme achievement. But those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment.
</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-5: 36-37)- As to those who reject Faith,- if they had everything on earth, and twice repeated, to give as ransom for the penalty of the Day of Judgment, it would never be accepted of them, theirs would be a grievous penalty. Their wish will be to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom; their penalty will be one that endures. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-7: 36-38)- But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance, they are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for ever). Who is more unjust than one who invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Signs? For such, their portion appointed must reach them from the Book (of decrees): until, when our messengers (of death) arrive and take their souls, they say: "Where are the things that ye used to invoke besides Allah?" They will reply, "They have left us in the lurch," And they will bear witness against themselves, that they had rejected Allah. He will say: "Enter ye in the company of the peoples who passed away before you - men and jinns, into the Fire." Every time a new people enters, it curses its sister-people (that went before), until they follow each other, all into the Fire. Saith the last about the first: "Our Lord! it is these that misled us; so give them a double penalty in the Fire." He will say: "Doubled for all", but this ye do not understand. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-8: 13-14)- This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger. If any contend against Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment. Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment), for those who resist Allah, is the penalty of the Fire."
(Quaran-9: 63)- Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, is the Fire of Hell, wherein they shall dwell? That is the supreme disgrace. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-10: 7-8)- Those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present, and those who heed not Our Signs, their abode is the Fire, because of the (evil) they earned. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-11: 15-17)- Those who desire the life of the present and its glitter, to them we shall pay (the price of) their deeds therein, without diminution. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but the Fire: vain are the designs they frame therein, and of no effect and the deeds that they do! Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it, a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon; for it is the truth from thy Lord; yet many among men do not believe! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-18:29)- Say, "The truth is from your Lord", Let him who will believe, and let him who will, reject (it); for the wrong-doers We have prepared a Fire whose (smoke and flames), like the walls and roof of a tent, will hem them in; if they implore relief they will be granted water like melted brass, that will scald their faces, how dreadful the drink! How uncomfortable a couch to recline on! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-40:70-74)- Those who reject the Book and the (revelations) with which We sent our messengers; but soon shall they know, When the yokes (shall be) round their necks, and the chains; they shall be dragged along; In the boiling fetid fluid; then in the Fire shall they be burned; Then shall it be said to them: "Where are the (deities) to which ye gave part-worship; "In derogation of Allah?" They will reply: "They have left us in the lurch. Nay, we invoked not, of old, anything (that had real existence)." Thus does Allah leave the Unbelievers to stray? </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-19:86-87)- "And We shall drive the sinners to Hell, like thirsty cattle driven down to water, and None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from (Allah) Most Gracious."
</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-9: 49)- Among them is (many) a man who says: "Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial." Have they not fallen into trial already? And indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides). </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-3: 56)-"As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-3: 176)â Let not those grieve thee who rush headlong into Unbelief. Not the least harm will they do to Allah. Allah's plan is that He will give them no portion in the Hereafter, but a severe punishment. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-67: 5-7)- And we have, (from of old), adorned the lowest heaven with Lamps, and We have made such (Lamps) (as) missiles to drive away the Evil Ones, and have prepared for them the Penalty of the Blazing Fire. For those who reject their Lord (and Cherisher) is the Penalty of Hell: and evil is (such), Destination. When they are cast therein, they will hear the (terrible) drawing in of its breath even as it blazes forth, </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-50:24-26)- (The sentence will be:) "Throw, throw into Hell every contumacious Rejecter (of Allah)! "Who forbade what was good, transgressed all bounds, cast doubts and suspicions; "Who set up another god beside Allah: Throw him into a severe penalty." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-21:97-100)- Then will the true promise draw nigh (of fulfillment); then behold! the eyes of the Unbelievers will fixedly stare in horror: "Ah! Woe to us! we were indeed heedless of this; nay, we truly did wrong!" Verily ye, (unbelievers), and the (false) gods that ye worship besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Hell! To it will ye (surely) come! If these had been gods, they would not have got there! But each one will abide therein. There, sobbing will be their lot, nor will they there hear (aught else). </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-4:55-56): Some of them believed, and some of them averted their faces from him. And enough is Hell for a burning fire. Those who reject our Signs, We shall soon cast into the Fire, as often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for fresh skins, that they may taste the penalty: for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.
</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran- 59: 16-17)- (Their allies deceived them), like the Evil One, when he says to man, "Deny Allah": but when (man) denies Allah, (the Evil One) says, "I am free of thee: I do fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!" The end of both will be that they will go into the Fire, dwelling therein for ever. Such is the reward of the wrong-doers.
</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-67:8-11)- Almost bursting with fury, every time a Group is cast therein, its Keepers will ask, "Did no Warner come to you?" They will say: "Yes indeed; a Warner did come to us, but we rejected him and said, 'Allah never sent down any (Message): ye are nothing but an egregious delusion!'" They will further say: "Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we should not (now) be among the Companions of the Blazing Fire!" They will then confess their sins: but far will be (Forgiveness) from the Companions of the Blazing Fire!
</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-46:20)- On the Day when those who disbelieve (in the Oneness of AllÃ¢h IslÃ¢mic Monotheism) will be exposed to the Fire (it will be said): "You received your good things in the life of the world, and you took your pleasure therein. Now this Day you shall be recompensed with a torment of humiliation, because you were arrogant in the land without a right, and because you used to rebel and disobey (AllÃ¢h)." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-3: 131)-Fear the Fire, which is prepared for those who reject Faith: </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-4:14)âBut those who disobey Allah and His Messenger and transgress His limits will be admitted to a Fire, to abide therein: And they shall have a humiliating punishment. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-5: 37)â Their wish will be to get out of the Fire, but never will they get out therefrom: their penalty will be one that endures. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-7:4-6)- How many towns have We destroyed (for their sins)? Our punishment took them on a sudden by night or while they slept for their afternoon rest. When (thus) Our punishment took them, no cry did they utter but this: "Indeed we did wrong." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-7: 36)-But those who reject Our signs and treat them with arrogance,- they are companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for ever). </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-8:12-14)- Remember thy Lord inspired the angels (with the message): "I am with you; give firmness to the Believers. I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers; smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off them." This because they contended against Allah and His Messenger. If any contend against Allah and His Messenger, Allah is strict in punishment. Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye then of the (punishment): for those who resist Allah, is the penalty of the Fire." </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-9: 63)â Know they not that for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, is the Fire of Hell? Wherein they shall dwell. That is the supreme disgrace. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-9:68)â Allah hath promised the Hypocrites men and women, and the rejecters, of Faith, the fire of Hell: Therein shall they dwell: Sufficient is it for them; for them is the curse of Allah, and an enduring punishment. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-10:8)â Their abode is the Fire, because of the (evil) they earned. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-11: 17)â Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it, a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon; for it is the truth from thy Lord; yet many among men do not believe! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-13:5)â If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: "When we are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-2: 89)â And when there comes to them a Book from Allah, confirming what is with them, although from of old they had prayed for victory against those without Faith, when there comes to them that which they (should) have recognized, they refuse to believe in it but the curse of Allah is on those without Faith. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-2:98)âWhoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and messengers, to Gabriel and Michael, Lo! Allah is an enemy to those who reject Faith. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(Quran-80: 39-42)- Laughing, rejoicing. And other faces that Day will be dust-stained, Blackness will cover them. Such will be the Rejecters of Allah, the doers of iniquity. </span></p>

There will be terrible punishment in hell for a hypocrite learned man. His bowels will gush forth and he will roam with his bowels as a donkey moves around a mill-stone. Muhammad said: If a man explains the Qur'an according to his opinion, let him seek his abode in hell. The business of exchange in coins is for the inmates of hell. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(p.2.202)
If a piece of cloth (so dirty & stinky) of the inmates of hell is exposed to the inmates of the world, all will die due to its terrible stench. Ditto for an iron chain of hell. Gabriel did not trust his rank with God lest God might punish him like Harut and Marut; that is why he wept in front of Muhammad. So God proclaimed that both of them will be spared from the punishment of hell. The color of fire in hell at present is dense black. Belly and sexual passion are the doors of hell and their root is eating with satisfaction. Humility and break of heart are the doors of Paradise and their root is hunger. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">p.3.249-250
Muhammad said, "Paradise and Hell once quarreled with each other. Hell said: I have been entrusted with the proud and oppressors. Paradise said: the weak, the destitute and the helpless will enter in me."
(This confirms that all poor, hungry and destitute Muslims will go to heaven; and rich, prosperous and happy people will go to hell)
</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(p.3.250; p.3.102)
Muhammad said, "The proud will be raised on the resurrection day as dwarfs. The people will go on treading with feet these dwarfs. The figure of everything will be higher than their figures. They will then be driven to a Hell name Bulas. Their food will be the fire of Hell and their drink will be Khobal or bloods and pusses of the dwellers of Hell." He who commits sin laughing will enter Hell weeping.
</span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">p.3.270
Muhammad said, 'On the Resurrection Day a learned man will be driven to Hell. His entrails will be cut to pieces and he will roam with that as an ass roams around the mill of oil. The dwellers of hell will ask him: What is your matter? He will say: I advised the people for good works but I did not do them myself. I prohibited the people from doing evil deeds but I myself did them ' </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(p.4.34; p.4.119; p.4.388)
The boys of the infidels and the deranged persons will be neither in Hell nor in Paradise. They will be in a place between Paradise and Hell, called A'araf or elevated place.Hadis: 999 out of 1 000 people will be in Hell. The first terror of death is the terrible pangs at the time of death. The second terror is the sight of the figure of angel of death and the entry of terror and fear in mind. The third terror is that the sinner sees his place in Hell and the virtuous one sees his place in Paradise. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(p.4.431)
Muhammad said, "There are 70,000 valleys in Hell and in each valley there are 70,000 serpents and 70,000 scorpions. The unbelievers will meet them."There are seven layers of Hell: the first and the highest layer is called Jahannam, the second layer is called Sakher, lower than it is Jai, lower than it is Hotamah, lower than it is Saierr, lower than it is Jahim, and the lowest layer is Habiyah.

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Now some hellish prescriptions from Sahih Hadiths </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari:</strong> (1.2.28; 4.54.482, 512; 4.54.483; 4.54.487; 4.55.567; 4.55.608)
Majority in hell are women because they are ungrateful to their husbands. Allah permitted the hellfire to take two breathsâthat is the reason for severe heat and a bitter cold in weather. [Shubahanallah!!!]. Fever is from the heat of hellfire; it can be cooled with Zam Zam water. Hell fire is sixty-nine times more intense than an ordinary fire. Children will become gray-haired; all pregnant women will have miscarriages; mankind will be drunken on the resurrection day; only one person in a thousand will be in Paradise (i.e 99.9% will be in hell) Malik is the gate-keeper of hell. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(4.56.667; 4.56.723: 7.69.538; 8.76.494; 6.60.371, 373; 8.76.552, 553; 8.76.562; 8.76.566, 567; 8.76.569; 8.76.587) </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Whoever intentionally tells lies about Muhammad will be in hellfire. Muhammad saw Amr bin 'Amir bin Luhai Al-Khuzai dragging his intestines in the (Hell) Fire, for he was the first man who started the custom of releasing animals (for the sake of false gods. On the resurrection day the hellfire will reach up to his anklet but his brain will still boil from this hellfire. Allah puts his foot over hell fire. If you drink in silver utensils you will be in hell fire. Hell fire is surrounded by all kinds of desires and possessions while Paradise is surrounded by all kinds of disliked and undesirable things. People of hellfire will have no death and the people of Paradise will have eternal life. Allah will chide the denizens of hell for ignoring His call to worship Him alone. The least punishment in hell is the boiling of brain. Abu Talib's brain will boil from the fire of hell. Apostates will be sent to hellfire. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sahih Muslim:</strong> (1.0045 ; 1.0199; 1.0259;1.0284)
If you believe in Allah and His messenger Muhammad then Allah would prohibit the fire of hell from you. Those Jews or Christians who have heard of Muhammad but do not believe in him will go to hell. The permanent inhabitants of hell will neither die nor live in hell. Temporary residents of hell will be burnt to charcoal and then spread over in paradise and sprinkled with water; then they will come back to life again. The inhabitants of hell will come out as if they were the wood of the ebony tree; then they will bathe in the river of paradise and will become as white as paper. The offenders will be caught with hooks that are suspended on the path to hell; the depth of hell is 70 years. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sahi Muslim: </strong>(1.0398; 2.0464; 3.40.4700)
Muhammad's father will be in hellfire; so will be all the unbelievers. Even if you feed the poor and be generous you will go to hell if you do not become a Muslim. Your feet will taste hellfire if you do not wash them during ablution. A believer's father who is not a Muslim will be in hell; so is the case for Muhammad's parents.
(This confirms that good people like "Mother teresha" will go to burning hell) </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sahi Muslim:</strong> (4.1926 ; 5.2163; 6.2570, 2572)
While preaching to the women Muhammad admonished them, as most of them were the fuels for hell because they grumble and are ungrateful to their husbands. If anyone hoards a treasure without paying zakat then his hoards would be heated in the fire of hell and made into plates, his forehead would be cauterized and this punishment would last for fifty thousand years. One day of fasting equals 70 years of distance from hellfire. On the day of Arafa Allah lets loose some Muslims from hell. If someone emancipates a Muslim slave then Allah will set him free from hell, an organ of his body, for every organ of slave's body. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sahi Muslim:</strong> (23.4962; 24.5209; 24.5310)
Wine is the discharges or the sweat of denizens of hell (Tinat-al-Khabul). Wearing a gold signet ring is like wishing live coal from hell and putting the coal on one's hand. Those women who are naked even in their dresses and lead their husbands to astray will go to hell. For everyone a seat has already been allotted in Paradise or Hell; so do good deeds to hasten to your seat in Paradise. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Sahi Muslim:</strong> (37.6665; 37.6666)
On the day of resurrection Allah would give a Muslim a Jew or a Christian to throw him into hell fire; this is to rescue the Muslims from the hell fire. A Jew or a Christian can be exchanged for a Muslim who was supposed to go to hellfire.
(This confirms how much Allah loved Jews and Christians, and also how much Muslims do respect other religions) </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Hadiths by Sunaan Abu Dawud:</strong> (2.0427; 2.14.2705; 8.1480; 3.35.4255)
No one will enter hell who has offered the dawn and afternoon prayers. If you see your brother's letter without his permission, you will see hell fire. Steal booty-face fire of hell. If anyone makes untruthful accusations against a Muslim, Allah will make him dwell in corrupt fluid flowing from the inhabitants of hell until he retracts his statement. When two Muslims fight with swords the killer and the killed will go to hell. Seventy-two of the seventy-three Muslim sects will go to hell; only one of the sects will be in Paradise, it is the majority group. </span>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(3.40.4686; 41.4895, 4896; 41.5220)
Allah put His hand on the back of Adam and brought forward Adam's offspring destined for Paradise, then Allah put his hand again on the back of Adam and brought forward the offspring of Adam destined for hell. One Muslim should not keep away from another Muslim for more than three days; if you do so you will enter hell. If you cut a lote tree you will go to hell. Do not dye your beard with black color. Black dye is the sign of the inmates of hell. If you dye your beard black you will not get the fragrance of Paradise. </span></blockquote>

<p align="justify"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Comments </span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Just as the creation of glittering and most luxurious Islamic heaven (having barrages of bogus hopes) was to incite/lure great attractions of Arab pagans towards Islam; likewise, the creation of extremely unnaturally and shockingly dreadful Islamic hell was to create profound panic and terror in order to intimidate those who reject Islam. Prophet Muhammad himself (not Allah) purposefully created/formulated these unthinkable, sickly horrific, fearful hellish stories of torture by his sheer hallucination and weird imagination. This only shows how cruel he was and how horrendously inhumane was his thinking process. His purpose was to punish non-Muslims (those who do not believe in Islam, such as Hindus, Christians, Jews, Sikhs and other polytheists), no matter how good human beings they were, or how much they believed in their own religion. According to the cruel wish of Prophet Muhammad they all will be dumped randomly to the Islamic hell. Jewish will be the first to enter Islamic hell, next are the Christians, Hindus, idolaters, and other un-believers. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">People of the books are Christians and Jews, and religion of truth means Islam. That is if they (people of the books) do not accept Islam, then they must be tortured and subdued to pay pole tax (Zizzya) and even to kill them or convert them by force (as per Quranic verse-9:29). This was the clear evidence of Muhammad's utter intolerance and great hatreds towards other religions (including Christianity and Judaism), which is prevailing till today in Saudi Arabia. By his cruel, sick and disgusting imaginationâProphet of Islam did every effort to create panic and terror among non-Muslims, so that out of fear they convert to Islam; or he always left clear instructions to his followers to convert unbelievers by the brutal force of Islamic jihad. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Most ridiculously disgusting thing is, this mad Pagan Allah is so angry and so cruel that He is not at all satisfied by putting un-believers in the blazing fire of hell. He will first feed those poor non-believers with poisonous Zaqqum tree which will simmer inside their stomachs, then He will put chain around their necks to drag them into the scalding boiling water, and then they will be left to burn in the blazing fire of Hell. On top of it He (Allah) will pour molten brass over their heads. In addition to these, He will whip them up with iron rods (hooks), so that they can not come out of blazing fire. Not only that, He will keep changing their roasted skins for fresh skins, so that those unbeliever kaffirs suffer the terrible pain for good; while those pious mumeen mussalmans will be enjoying the beautiful 72 virgins and young boys in the Islamic heaven. No wonder Quran puts the prefixes for Allah at the beginning of every chapter withâmost Merciful, most beneficent, most compassionate, most cherisher, and most sustainer of this poor universe! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">In my boyhood, I learned from our Huzur (Mullah) that only Muslims will enter the heaven, i.e. no other non-Muslims will ever enter the heaven, period. That is, people like Mother Teresa or other non-Muslims who were best human beings on earth will never get to see heaven. Even those non-Muslim scientists (kaffirs) who invented medicine, airplane, electricity, computer etc. will never enter the heavenâbecause they were not Muslims. But Muslims those who used readily all those scientific miracles invented by kaffirsâwill surely go to heaven. All Islamic mullahs like Allama Moududi, Khomeini of Iran, Syeedi, Golam Azam, Nizami gong of Bangladesh, and Osama Bin Laden and his jihadi gang will definitely occupy the best of the heavens! </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">According to Quranic verse: (The darkening: 15-20) even Allah recognizes and respects the word of Prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe that, in the day of resurrection Allah will sit on His mighty thrown and Muhammad will sit at the right side of Him. Only Muhammad will be given the power of intercession, and it is only Prophet Muhammad will decide who will go to heaven, and who will go to hell. The Great compassionate Prophet Mohammad will allow only Mumeen Mussalmans to enter the Islamic heaven; and the Kaffirs (Pagans, Christians, Jews, idolaters and others) will go to Islamic hell. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The Muslims will not have to be better humans than those kaffirs. All they have to do is utter the Kalema (incantation) by which one convert to a Muslim: ""there is no God but Allah and Mohammad is his Prophet." After that they have the clear license to kill as many kaffirs as they could or pleased, looting and burning their belongings and enslaving their women and children as Allah's gift of war booty. It is also commonly believed by Muslims that at the time of deathâif the Muslim simply can utter the above 'Kalema' he will be forgiven for all his sins that he committed during his entire life. A college friend of mine was never prayed in his entire life. When I asked him what will happen to him after his death, he said: "at the time of my death, I will simply utter the Kalema Toiyabâand Inshallah I will enter the heaven." Folks, this is what Islam teaches to the 1.2 Billion robots. Praise to Pagan Allah!!! </span></p>
