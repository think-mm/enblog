<p>What Islam or Muslims say or practices are not always having a positive meaning. Most of the times, their claims could be quite opposite, bogus practice, or deceptive to non-Muslims. Their religious rituals and sayings could have totally opposite meaning. Let us examine one case in point the Ramadan, which is one of the most famously pious rituals of Islam.</p>
<p>Muslims practice month-long fasting called <strong>Ramadan</strong>. Ramadan's main purpose is to practice economic bail-tightening, and self-struggling, and self-purifying—in order to make economical savings and also by eating less amount of foods (fasting) to realize the painful condition of a starving hungry human. In other words, fasting is for reducing economical expenditure or economical pressure by practicing self-restrain or reducing personal luxury, lusts, or comfort etc.  But in reality—Muslims does the opposite! Muslims those who are fasting during this month of Ramadan, practice a total orgy of eating more delicacies and drinking, of course during night instead of day time. A typical fasting Muslim consumes double the amount of most nourishing and delicious and luxurious food items compared to his regular eating habits during other times. Monthly expenditures for a typical family duly increased 2-3 times during Ramadan than the expenditure of other single month during the entire year. That means, Muslims are engaged in much bigger spending spree than other months of the year. Instead of sacrificing self-comfort and self-interest and luxuries—Muslims began a big and gorgeous month-long celebration of vigorous spending and eating orgies.</p>
<p>Remarkably to note is their weird culture of <strong>Iftar-Party Politics (IPP)</strong>. One can witness how much foods they gobble (waste) in this month-long un-holy activities of <strong>IPP</strong>. There goes a total competition of eating several dozens of tasty and expensive food items in this IPP. This is what they call self-restraining to realize the pains of poor and hungry people! As if, poor people do eat so much foods (which they try to simulate so piously) and still remain hungry!</p>
<p>####Prices of common commodities bound to go up!</p>
<p>Because of these unholy practices and Islamic deceptions, prices of common commodities such as food items and other necessary items go up to the roof, causing more untold misery to the poor people. No govt. control can prevent this obvious price increases in the month of Ramadan every year. Fact is, Muslims actually <strong>consume more foods and luxury items during Ramadan than other times of the year.</strong> A fasting man will consume more foods in total than his contemporary non-fasting man in the same family. Because, fasting man will consume all the most nutritious and expensive tasty foods, of course, during nights, which normally they hardly do during other months. Therefore, <strong>supply and demands get unbalanced</strong> and business people can not keep the price down because of <strong>very high demands</strong>. The ultimate purpose of self-restrain or sacrificing by fasting goes down the drain.</p>
<h4 id="some-facts-myths-of-ramadan-and-reality">Some facts &amp; myths of Ramadan and reality!</h4>
<p><strong>National Productivity</strong>: National productivity of all Muslim nations bound to go down in this month due to serious disruptions of business as usual. All educational institutes remain shut-down for entire month. Muslims do not work during this month very much, and <strong>they reach their office mostly late and go home early</strong>. All Arab nations (Muslims) basically do not work at all during this month. Arabs even do not sleep during the night also. They remain awake and busy eating and drinking all night long; and after their Shehari (pr-morning meal)—they go for a long deep-sleep in holy comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Charity and donations</strong>: Mullahs and Islamic scholars brag that, the so called fasting during Ramadan teach Muslims to do charity to the poor people; but in reality, Muslims give charity very little or negligible in quantity. While non-Muslims kaffirs of the East and west (especially American kaffirs) give 80% of the world's charity to the poor nations.</p>
<p>**Health benifits: **Some Islamists unscrupulously brag that—fasting during Ramadan is highly beneficial to health. This claim of course has no scientific basis and an untrue statement by the Muslims. In fact, this kind of fasting is highly harmful to health, as a result, Muslims are the unhealthy people on earth and their longevity is one of the lowest in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Allah keeps Satans chained during Ramadan</strong>: Islamic mullahs claim that during this holy month—Allah keeps all Satans chained (arrested and confined) so that they can never do any bad thing in this month of Ramadan. <strong>This claim is utterly bogus and clearly untrue</strong>. Just look what is happening around the world, especially, in the Muslim world (Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan). Right from the day one of Ramadan—there goes an 'utopia' of suicide bombings to kill scores of innocent people.</p>
<p>Country like Bangladesh, corruptions and killings by beheading (especially in Kustia) is going on almost daily basis. Crimes are rampant in the whole Muslim world during this month of Ramadan. Just other day, even in Saudi Arabia (the birth place of Islam) terrorists were about to kill Saudi prince by suicide terrorism. There is no statistic which can claim that—during the month of Ramadan, crimes are low by any means! Is it possible that Allah forgot to chain all those Satans he created?</p>
<p><strong>Ramadan makes Muslims honest and pure</strong>: This is purely a myth and a bogus assumption by the Islamists. Muslims are the most corrupt people on earth by all possible parameters, and by all scientific statistics. Nobody can deny that!</p>
<p>Fact is, Ramadan—the month-long fasting is a mockery to their claims and this unscientific and unnecessary fasting during the day-time and eating utopia (<strong>voracious munching of foods</strong>) during the night instead of daytime is unhealthy, unnecessary and most unproductive practice. Ramadan is only pushing all the Muslim nations to more poverty and dependant to others. Economically, Muslims get weaker due to unbalanced expenditure and much less productivity and less business during Ramadan. Hence, fasting or Ramadan is another <strong>Islamic self-deception</strong>, to say the least.</p>
