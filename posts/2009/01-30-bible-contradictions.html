        <p>~ <em>Dan Barker</em></p>
<blockquote><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>[Moderator's note: </strong>The following article is excerpted from Dan Barker's recent book,  "Godless". Dan Barker (born June 25, 1949) is a prominent American atheist activist who served as a Christian preacher and musician for 20 years, but left Christianity in 1984. After almost 20 years of evangelical preaching, missionizing, and Christian songwriting, Dan Barker <a href="https://ffrf.org/books/lfif/?t=lostfaith"><span style="color: #0000cc; font-family: Arial;">started loosing his faith in faith</span></a>. In Godless, Barker describes the intellectual and psychological path he followed in moving from fundamentalism to freethought. Godless includes sections on biblical morality, the historicity of Jesus, biblical contradictions, the unbelievable resurrection, and much more. It is an arsenal for skeptics and a direct challenge to believers. Along the way, Barker relates the positive benefit readers will experience from learning to trust in reason and human kindness instead of living in fear of false judgment and moral condemnation. He is the current co-president of the <a href="https://ffrf.org/"><span style="color: #0000cc; font-family: Arial;">Freedom From Religion Foundation</span></a>, an American Freethought organization that promotes the separation of church and state.</span>
<p><span style="color: #008000;">While Abul Kasem is writing an important  series on <a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/?p=69"><span style="color: #0000cc; font-family: Arial;">Quranic contradictions</span></a> in our site, I thought readers will be interested to know the contradictions in other 'holy books' too!</span></blockquote></p>

<p align="center"><em><span style="color: #800000;">"It ain't those parts of the Bible that I can't understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand." ~ Mark Twain</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">PAUL SAID, &quot;God is not the author of confusion,&quot; (I Corinthians 14:33), yet never has a book produced more confusion than the bible! There are hundreds of denominations and sects, all using the &quot;inspired Scriptures&quot; to prove their conflicting doctrines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Why do trained theologians differ? Why do educated translators disagree over Greek and Hebrew meanings? Why all the confusion? Shouldn't a document that was &quot;divinely inspired&quot; by an omniscient and omnipotent deity be as clear as possible?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&quot;If the trumpet give an uncertain sound,&quot; Paul wrote in I Corinthians 14:8, &quot;who shall prepare himself to the battle? So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.&quot; Exactly! Paul should have practiced what he preached. For almost two millennia, the bible has been producing a most &quot;uncertain sound.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The problem is not with human limitations, as some claim. The problem is the bible itself. People who are free of theological bias notice that the bible contains hundreds of discrepancies. Should it surprise us when such a literary and moral mish-mash, taken seriously, causes so much discord? Here is a brief sampling of biblical contradictions.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Should we kill?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 20:13 "Thou shalt not kill." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Leviticus 24:17 "And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 32:27 "Thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, . . . and slay every man his brother, . . . companion, . . . neighbor." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I Samuel 6:19 " . . . and the people lamented because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I Samuel 15:2,3,7,8 "Thus saith the Lord . . . Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. . . . And Saul smote the Amalekites . . . and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Numbers 15:36 "And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hosea 13:16 "they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with children shall be ripped up." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">For a discussion of the defense that the Commandments prohibit only murder, see "Murder, He Wrote", chapter 27 (Losing Faith In Faith: From Preacher To Atheist).</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Should we tell lies?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 20:16 "Thou shalt not bear false witness." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Proverbs 12:22 "Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I Kings 22:23 "The Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the Lord hath spoken evil concerning thee." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">II Thessalonians 2:11 "And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Also, compare Joshua 2:4-6 with James 2:25.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Should we steal?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 20:15 "Thou shalt not steal." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Leviticus 19:13 "Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor, neither rob him." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 3:22 "And ye shall spoil the Egyptians." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 12:35-36 "And they spoiled [plundered, NRSV] the Egyptians." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Luke 19:29-34 "[Jesus] sent two of his disciples, Saying, Go ye into the village . . . ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. . . . And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? And they said, The Lord hath need of him." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I was taught as a child that when you take something without asking for it, that is stealing.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Shall we keep the sabbath?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 20:8 "Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 31:15 "Whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Numbers 15:32,36 "And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. . . . And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Isaiah 1:13 "The new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">John 5:16 "And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Colossians 2:16 "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy-day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Shall we make graven images?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 20:4 "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven . . . earth . . . water." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Leviticus 26:1 "Ye shall make ye no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Deuteronomy 27:15 "Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 25:18 "And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I Kings 7:15,16,23,25 "For he [Solomon] cast two pillars of brass . . . and two chapiters of molten brass . . . And he made a molten sea . . . it stood upon twelve oxen . . . [and so on]" </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Are we saved through works?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ephesians 2:8,9 "For by grace are ye saved through faith . . . not of works." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Romans 3:20,28 "Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Galatians 2:16 "Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">James 2:24 "Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 19:16-21 "And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And he [Jesus] said unto him . . . keep the commandments. . . . The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The common defense here is that "we are saved by faith and works." But Paul said "not of works."</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Should good works be seen?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 5:16 "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I Peter 2:12 "Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that . . . they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 6:1-4 "Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them . . . that thine alms may be in secret." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 23:3,5 "Do not ye after their [Pharisees'] works. . . . all their works they do for to be seen of men." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Should we own slaves?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Leviticus 25:45-46 "Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, . . . and they shall be your possession . . . they shall be your bondmen forever." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 9:25 "And he [Noah] said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 21:2,7 "If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. . . . And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the manservants do." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Joel 3:8 "And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the Lord hath spoken it." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Luke 12:47,48 [Jesus speaking] "And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Colossians 3:22 "Servants, obey in all things your masters." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Isaiah 58:6 "Undo the heavy burdens . . . let the oppressed go free, . . . break every yoke." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 23:10 "Neither be ye called Masters: for one is your Master, even Christ." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Pro-slavery bible verses were cited by many churches in the South during the Civil War, and were used by some theologians in the Dutch Reformed Church to justify apartheid in South Africa. There are more pro-slavery verses than cited here.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Does God change his mind?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Malachi 3:6 "For I am the Lord; I change not." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Numbers 23:19 "God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ezekiel 24:14 "I the Lord have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">James 1:17 " . . . the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 32:14 "And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 6:6,7 "And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth . . . And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth . . . for it repenteth me that I have made him." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Jonah 3:10 ". . . and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">See also II Kings 20:1-7, Numbers 16:20-35, Numbers 16:44-50.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">See Genesis 18:23-33, where Abraham gets God to change his mind about the minimum number of righteous people in Sodom required to avoid destruction, bargaining down from fifty to ten. (An omniscient God must have known that he was playing with Abraham's hopes for mercy--he destroyed the city anyway.)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Are we punished for our parents' sins?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 20:5 "For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation." (Repeated in Deuteronomy 5:9) </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 34:6-7 " . . . The Lord God, merciful and gracious, . . . that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I Corinthians 15:22 "For as in Adam all die, . . ." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ezekiel 18:20 "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Deuteronomy 24:16 "The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Is God good or evil?</span></h3>

	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Psalm 145:9 "The Lord is good to all." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Deuteronomy 32:4 "a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Isaiah 45:7 "I make peace and create evil. I the Lord do all these things." See "Out of Context" for more on Isaiah 45:7. </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Lamentations 3:38 "Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?" </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Jeremiah 18:11 "Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Ezekiel 20:25,26 "I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live. And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Does God tempt people?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">James 1:13 "Let no man say . . . I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 22:1 "And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Is God peaceable?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Romans 15:33 "The God of peace." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Isaiah 2:4 ". . . and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Exodus 15:3 "The Lord is a man of war." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Joel 3:9-10 "Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Was Jesus peaceable?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">John 14:27 "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Acts 10:36 "The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Luke 2:14 " . . . on earth peace, good will toward men." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 10:34 "Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. And a man's foes shall be they of his own household." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Luke 22:36 "Then said he unto them, . . . he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Was Jesus trustworthy?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">John 8:14 "Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">John 5:31 "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">"Record" and "witness" in the above verses are the same Greek word (martyria).</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Shall we call people names?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 5:22 "Whosoever shall say Thou fool, shall be in danger of hellfire." [Jesus speaking] </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>

<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">How many Gods are there?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Deuteronomy 6:4 "The Lord our God is one Lord." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>

	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 3:22 "And the Lord God said, Behold, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I John 5:7 "And there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It does no good to claim that "Let us" is the magisterial "we." Such usage implies inclusivity of all authorities under a king's leadership. Invoking the Trinity solves nothing because such an idea is more contradictory than the problem it attempts to solve.</span></li>

	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Luke 1:6 "And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">How old was Ahaziah?</span></h3>
<ul>

	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 21:22-24,31 " . . . swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me . . . And Abraham said, I will swear. . . . Wherefore he called that place Beersheba ["well of the oath"]; because there they sware both of them." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Hebrews 6:13-17 "For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself . . . for men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">See also Genesis 22:15-19, Genesis 31:53, and Judges 11:30-39.</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 5:34-37 "But I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by heaven . . . nor by the earth . . . . Neither shalt thou swear by thy head . . . . But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." </span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">James 5:12 ". . . swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation." </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">When was Jesus crucified?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Mark 15:25 "And it was the third hour, and they crucified him." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">John 19:14-15 "And about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! But they cried out . . . crucify him." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">It is an <em>ad hoc</em> defense to claim that there are two methods of reckoning time here. It has never been shown that this is the case.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Shall we obey the law?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I Peter 2:13 "Submit yourself to every ordinance of man . . . to the king, as supreme; Or unto governors." </span></li>

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 1:12-31 "And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: . . . And the evening and the morning were the third day. . . . And God said, Let us make man in our image . . . And the evening and the morning were the sixth day." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 2:5-9 "And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. .Ê.ÊAnd the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground . . . And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.

<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Does God accept human sacrifice?</span></h3>

	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Genesis 22:2 "And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of." </span></li>

So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon . . . and the Lord delivered them into his hands. . . . And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: . . . And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed." </span></li>

<h3><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Who was Joseph's father?</span></h3>
<ul>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Matthew 1:16 "And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus." </span><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>vs.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Luke 3:23 "And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli." </span></li>
</ul>
<hr /><span style="font-family: Verdana;">This chapter was first printed as a "nontract," a freethinkers' version of a (non-proselytizing) tract. Since it was first published, I have received numerous replies from Christians who think that these contradictions are either trivial or easily explained. Yet not a single "explanation" has been convincing. Most of them do little homework, inventing off-the-cuff defenses of what the bible "could have meant," or devising creative explanations that actually make the problem worse. For example, one Christian, agreeing with Eusebius, explained that "Thou shalt not bear false witness" does not prohibit lies, and that God actually wants us to tell falsehoods if it will further the kingdom of heaven.</span>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Many of the defensive attempts are arguments from silence. Some apologists assert that since the writer of John does not say that there were not more women who visited the tomb with Mary, then it is wrong to accuse him of contradicting the other evangelists who say it was a group of women. But this is a non-argument. With this kind of thinking, I could claim that the people who accompanied Mary to the tomb included Mother Teresa, Elvis Presley, and Paul Bunyan. Since the writer of John does not specifically exclude these people, then there is no way to prove that this is not true--if such fragile logic is valid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">All of the above contradictions have been carefully studied, and when necessary the original languages have been consulted. Although it is always scholarly to consider the original languages, why should that be necessary with the &quot;word of God?&quot; An omnipotent, omniscient deity should have made his all-important message unmistakably clear to everyone, everywhere, at all times. No one should have to learn an extinct language to get God's message, especially an ancient language about which there is much scholarly disagreement. If the English translation is flawed or imprecise, then God failed to get his point across to English speakers. A true fundamentalist should consider the English version of the bible to be just as inerrant as the original because if we admit that human error was possible in the translation, then it was equally possible in the original writing. (Some fundamentalists do assert that the King James Version is perfect. One preacher reportedly said, &quot;If the King James Version was good enough for the Apostle Paul, then it's good enough for me.&quot;) If a contradiction exists in English, then the bible is contradictory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The above list of thirty-three contradictions is a very small portion of the <em>thousands</em> of biblical discrepancies that have been catalogued by scholars. See &quot;Leave No Stone Unturned&quot; for seventeen additional contradictions specific to the resurrection of Jesus. One monthly publication, &quot;Biblical Errancy,&quot; is devoted entirely to this topic (published by Dennis McKinsey, 3158 Sherwood Park Drive, Springfield OH, 45505.) Even if a defender of the bible were to eliminate all of the above (and no one has come close), we are still only scratching the surface. The bible is a flawed book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Why should it surprise us that the Bible is contradictory? Pick up any newspaper and you will find the contradictions. The Bible was written by dozens of authors with diverse agendas, most of whom did not know each other, over hundreds of years. They were human beings, and human beings can make mistakes. The Bible does contain some truth but no honest person can pretend that it is a perfect book. Combined with the exaggerations, scientific inaccuracies, borrowing from pagan sources, evidence of tempering and clearly irrelevant passages aimed at bygone, primitive and superstitious people; the contradictions underscore the fact that on balance, the Bible is not a reliable source of truth. </span></p>
