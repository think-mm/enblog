<div><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"><img class="clr" title="Muslim Virtue" src="https://www.islammonitor.org/uploads/pics/virtue.jpg" alt="Muslim Virtue" hspace="8" vspace="3" width="199" height="174" align="left" />Some so called modern Islamic apologists often try to fool the western infidels that Islam is a very simple religion and Islam never lures Muslims with erotic heavenly pleasures. Nothing could be furthest from the truth then this ridiculous claim of Islamists. Let's examine very closely the facts about Islamic heaven.
<p>If we research on the heavens of world's five famous religions this is what we can learn: Both Judaism and Christianity talk about heaven but do not describe what is in there! Hinduism talks about heaven and give some earthly material pleasures but does not go any further. Buddhism does not believe in after-life, and do not have any hell or heaven. They believe hell and heaven exists on this earth.
</span></div></p>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">But Islam emphatically describes many forms of heavens (at least 8 of them with various status/classes) with plenty of earthly greed's and lusting/erotic pleasures which not many human beings (made of soil) can refuse to get it. Muslims devoutly pray at least five times (some pray even 10 times) a day, visit Mekka and fawns Pirs and Darbishes (Saints) just to get the ultimate ticket for those lustful happiness of heavens.</span></div>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"><img title="Mo in Paradise" src="https://www.islammonitor.org/uploads/pics/paradise2.jpg" alt="Mo in Paradise" width="380" height="365" /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Muhammad in paradise on his famous night journey, where he could observe all the "earthly", sensual pleasures that only a few mortals could enjoy during their life time.</strong> </span></div>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">
<p>In my childhood I asked our Huzur (Imam of the Mosque) what exactly will be the likes of heavenly rewards from Allah for which all Muslims are fawning Allah by five times prayers per day, and fasting for one month. The Imam shaheb replied:<em> &quot;after your death you will be resurrected again as an healthy young man of 25 year old. There in the heaven you will be given beautiful Houris/Gillman, wine, and plenty of foods to eat. You will stay young for ever and death, disease will never come near you again.&quot;</em> Folks, all those Islamic Mullahs, Maoulanas, all those Jihadis of Kashmir, Palestine, Osama-Bin-Laden's terrorist gang, and all other gullible Muslims ardently believe just that.</p>
<p>Islamic Allah and Prophet Muhammad frequently promised believers of Islam with lustful heavens and erotic pleasures of various kinds which we shall encounter later in this essay. Holy Quran got hundreds of such verses, and myriad's of Sahih Hadiths dealing Houris and wine and sex for those pious Muslims. Truth of the matter is myth (superstitions), sex and violence are the main pillars of Islam. Below are some samples of divine promises from the Merciful Allah and Compassionate Prophet of Islam.  </span></div></p>

<strong>
Now some Sahih Hadiths:</strong>
<p></span></div></p>
<div><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">The main themes of the are: if Jihadi Muslims survive the battle, they secure concubines and plenty of booty, but if they fall (die), they are sure to enter paradise full of houris, wine and living in the most luxurious environment.
<p></span></p>
<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>TIRMIZI, vol. 2 states on  page 138:</strong> Every man who enters paradise shall be given 72 (seventy-two) houris; no matter at what age he had died, when he is admitted into paradise, he will become a thirty-year-old, and shall not age any further. A man in paradise shall be given virility equal to that of one hundred men.

<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Hadis number 1067:</strong>
<strong>Tirmidhi</strong>
<strong>Narrated Al-Miqdam ibn Ma'dikarib</strong>
Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, "The martyr receives six good things from Allah: he is forgiven at the first shedding of his blood; he is shown his abode in Paradise; he is preserved from the punishment in the grave; he is kept safe from the greatest terror; he has placed on his head the crown of honour, a ruby of which is better than the world and what it contains; he is married to seventy-two wives of the maidens with large dark eyes; and is made intercessor for seventy of his relatives." (Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted it).
 </span></blockquote>
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">
Ghilman (Young Boys):  In sura: (52:24) Allah promises to supply young diamond-sparkling beautiful boys for some<img class="clr" title="Reward" src="https://www.islammonitor.org/uploads/pics/youth.jpg" alt="Reward" hspace="8" vspace="6" width="238" height="388" align="right" /> inhabitants of Islamic heavens. Some deceitful western living mullahs will argue that these boys are there to serve drinks to the pious inhabitants of the heavens and not for having sex by those Beduin homosexual Jihadi Martyrs. They also will argue that Koran did not specify that these Ghilman (young boys) will be used as sex partners by Martyrs, i.e., it was not said so in the Quran. Well, Koran also did not specify what those Martyrs/pious Muslims suppose to do with the wide-eyed, firmed, swollen breast, white skinned beautiful houris! Your parent gets you married a beautiful young lady, and parents never say what you suppose to do with your wife, do they?  Decietful Mullah's logic/excuse that these Ghilman could be there as the waiters just to serve drinks and food does not sound right. I don't think it is the purpose of supplying young boys just to be the waiters. Waiters could be adult person instead of pearl-sparkling everlasting young boys! Is not it folks?  
<p><strong>The Sex Market of Heaven (Islamic brothel) according to Ihya Uloom Ed-Din:
</strong>
Allah has arranged for Pious Muslims a non-stop and non-interrupted sex in Islamic heavens because Mullahs will remain busy only with unlimited sex and wine for billions of years to come. These are rewards from the merciful Allah for killing and torturing those enemies of Allah by Mumeen Muslims.</p>
<p>In the Hadiths the Prophet Muhammad gave the believers a final choice of a open sex market in heaven where there will be no limit of the number of sexual partners. Women are in display like open fruit market.  Hadith:  Al hadiths, Vol. 4, Page-172, No.34:  Hozrot Ali (r.a) narrated that the Apostle of Allah said, &quot;There is in paradise an open market wherein there will be no buying or selling, but will consist of men and women. When a man desires a beauty, at once he will have intercourse with them as desired.</p>
<p>In this open sex market of heaven one can easily imagine what type of fun is going to happen there. Say one particular day of heaven—one very pious Muslim (who prayed five times a day and visited Mecca) who has been permitted to the best of Islamic heaven. There one day he decided to visit (out of curiosity) the famous sex market of heaven, and when he reached there, he found out that all his great great grandfathers,  grandfather,  father, brothers also were there visiting &quot;Islamic Brothel&quot; called heavenly sex market.  Now, they all got excited by the paragon beauty of heavenly houris with very swollen breasts, dark eyes and fair skin. The great great grandfather will command all his descendents family members to feel free to enjoy the sweet taste of houris. In that case the great great grandfathers, grandfather, father, brothers—they all will start simultaneous orgy of sexual intercourse right in front of each others. Can you imagine that terrific scenery folks?  Allah is really great <img title="Sex Market" src="https://www.islammonitor.org/uploads/pics/sexmarket.jpg" alt="Sex Market" width="176" height="260" align="left" />and merciful indeed!</p>
<p><strong>Now Some Descriptions of Houris from Quran and hadiths:</strong></p>
<p></span></p>
<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Quran-(78: 33-34)</strong> The houris are ever-young full-breasted (mature) maidens of equal age having swelling (protruding/pointed) bosoms, and a full cup of wine."
<strong>Quran- (55:56):</strong> "Wherein both will be Qasirat-ut-Tarf (chaste females restraining their glances, desiring none except their husband) with whom no man or jinni has had tamth before them."
 </span></blockquote>
<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>MISHKAT, (volume three Says on pages 83-97):</strong>  If a houri looks down from her abode in heaven onto the earth, the whole distance (space) shall be filled with light and fragrance. A houri's face is more radiant than a mirror, and one can see one's image in her cheek. The marrow of her shins is visible to the eyes.
 </span></blockquote>
<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>TIRMZI, volume two (p 35-40):</strong> A houri is a most beautiful young woman with a transparent body. The marrow of her bones is visible like the interior lines of pearls and rubies. She looks like red wine in a white glass.  She is of white color, and free from the routine physical disabilities of an ordinary woman such as menstruation, menopause, urinal and offal discharge, child bearing and the related pollution.  A houri is a girl of tender age, having large breasts which are round (pointed), and not inclined to dangle.  Houris dwell in palaces of splendid surroundings.

Here are some incredible stuff in heaven waiting for Mumeen Muslims.
Book by the great Imam Ghazzali: Ihya Uloom Ed-Din. The Sunnis consider this epic as next to Quran.

<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;">Muhammad said that an inmate of Paradise will have the sexual strength of 70 men. Muhammad said, "An inmate of Paradise will have 500 Hurs, 4,000 unmarried women and 8,000 widowed women.

<div><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">An appropriate Sahih Hadith for coping with the sexual urge of 500 houris, 4,000 unmarried women and 8,000 widowed women for each Mumeen Muslim:</span></div>

<div style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Ibn Majah, vol.v, page 547: Hadis number 4337</strong>Abu 'Umama (Allah be pleased with him) reported that Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: "Allah will not admit anyone in the Paradise but Allah, the Mighty and glorious will marry him with 72 wives, two will be from virgin (haurine) with big eyes and seventy will be his inheritance from the people of the Hell-Fire." Every one of them will have a pleasant vagina and he (the man) will have sexual organ that does not bend down during sexual intercourse (perpetual erection).</span></div></blockquote>
<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;">Hashim b. Khalid says, 'The words "out of his inheritance (due) from the denizens of the Fire", mean men who will enter the Fire and the inmates of the paradise will inherit their wives just as the Faroah's wife will be inherited (by the believers).
 </span></blockquote>
</div>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">
(I must conclude here that, Allah and Prophet Muhammad is really merciful and compassionate enough to give each Mumeen Mussalman sexual virility of 100 men, and a permanent penile erection so that he can handle very easily all those thousands of women and houris. Allah also arranged some heavenly benefits for the wives of infidels (especially American kaffirs) who will be allowed to serve inmates of heaven as extra pleasures, but I could not find any such heavenly arrangement for our pious Muslimahs! Sorry Muslim ladies, you will probably fill the hells, as our most merciful Prophet Muhammad said: "Hell will be filled with women" in hadith.  Sorry!!! )</span></div>

Muhammad said, "If an inmate of Paradise will wish to have a son born to him, he will get it. It stays in womb, its weaning away from milk and its youth will come to pass at the same time." Muhammad said, "The inmates of Paradise will be beardless and hairless. Their color will be white and their eyes painted with collyrium. They will be youth of 33 years of age.

More good stuff from the famous book of Imam Ghazali (Ihya Uloom Ed-Din)</strong>
<p><strong>Who will go to paradise first?</strong>
<strong>
</strong></span></p>
<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>(P1.117; P.1.149-150; p.1.181)</strong>
It is compulsory to believe in Paradise and Hell. Unconditional Paradise is assured for him who works as an Imam in a mosque. A Muazzin (crier of prayer) will enter Paradise unconditionally after his service of forty years. Your Imam is the representative of God on your behalf. An Imam stands between God and His servants. Pray behind an Imam to enter Paradise. You can knock at the door of Paradise through fasting.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote style="color: #cc3300;"><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000000; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>p.3.204</strong>
Muhammad said, 'The poor refugees will enter Paradise five hundred years before the rich refugees. The poor believers will enter Paradise before the rich believers.  They will be engaged in enjoyment of food and drink when the rich will remain down on their knees. God will say, "I have got questions to ask you: You have wielded power over men. You were kings and rulers over them. Now inform me what actions have you done with the gifts I gave you."' [Key factor why Muslims all over the world are damn poor].</span></blockquote>

Muhammad said, "Those who will be the chiefs in Paradise among the believers are those who could not procure their night meal after morning meal, who did not get any loan when asked for, who had no cloth except what they got to cover their shame and who could not procure even their necessary things, yet they were satisfied with their Lord at all times. They were those persons on whom God showered His blessing—the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs and the religious people."

Muhammad said, "Shall I not inform you of the dwellers of Paradise?—every weak and neglected man. If he is given oath in the name of God, makes him to fulfill it. Shall I not inform you of the inmates of Hell?—every proud, haughty and harsh man."
Muhammad said, "Those who are disheveled in hair, dust ridden, dressed in torn and tattered clothes, hated by people, those who are not given permission to go to the ruler when prayed for, who are not given girls in marriage when sought, who are not heard when they talk, whose wants and complaints are extinguished in their minds--they are the dwellers of Paradise. If their light is distributed among the people on the Resurrection Day, it would be sufficient for them."   [Key factor why Muslims all over the world are damn poor].</span></blockquote>

Muhammad said that, "during the resurrection day God will provide wings to group of his followers; they will fly to Paradise with the help of those wings. This was due to their devotion to God when they spent their time in solitude." Muhammad also said, "He who keeps sitting in a mosque will meet God. If anyone seeks Paradise, he should not sleep at night; he who fears God takes rest at dawn. If you suffer from epilepsy you will go to paradise. There are two Paradises of silver utensils and two Paradises of Gold utensils.  A Houri will fill the heaven and earth with light and scent and a martyr (Jihadist) would like to come back and be killed again and again." <img class="outline" title="Mo in Heaven" src="https://www.islammonitor.org/uploads/pics/moinheaven.jpg" border="8" alt="Mo in Heaven" hspace="8" width="197" height="319" align="right" /></span></blockquote>

The Blackstone (of Ka'ba) is a jewel from Paradise. It will be raised on the resurrection day. It will have two eyes and one tongue with which it will speak. It will bear for everyone who kissed it and testified its truth. Allah made Ka'ba 2 000 years before He created Adam.</p>

<strong>Classes/grades of Islamic heavens: </strong>
<p>Just as there are many classes of hotels such as: two stars, three stars, four stars and five stars with various luxurious style and amenities to enjoy by the occupants; Islamic heavens are also of different classes and grades ready (by Allah SWT) for different classes of Mumin musalman who are bound to occupy them according to their respective pious achievements on earth, especially the number of kaffirs they have killed by suicide bombings and Islamic beheadings. Below are some classes of heavens,</p>

Prophet Muhammad (SW) said, "The lowest rank of an inmate of Paradise will have eighty thousand servants and seventy-two wives."
<p><strong>Sahih Muslim: 1.0363; 20.4690, 4691</strong>
The lowest ranking people of paradise receive 10 times of what they desire; the highest ranking people of paradise will be hand-picked by Allah; Allah will reward them with bounties which no eye has ever seen, no ear has heard and no human mind has perceived. Two-third of booty for the jihadists will be paid in paradise, they will get one-third in this world. If they do not get any booty in this world then they will get full reward hereafter.

<strong>Conclusion:  </strong>
<p>It is quite evident from the Quran and Sahih hadiths that Islamic heaven is full of lusts and earthly greed which had been formulated by Prophet Muhammad himself only to lure Arab Bedouin to join his venture of plundering, killing, rapping innocent Arab pagans and others who refused to believe his weird religion of Allah. Prophet Muhammad was extremely intelligent, cruelest, and very cunning human being indeed!  He realized very well that to materialize his narcissistic dream, he needed to incite/energized Bedouin illiterate and desperately vagabond poor Arabs to unite and fight his enemy the Pagans and Jews.</p>
<p>He understood very well, as to, what could be the crucial objects/materials that will be most attractive to those Pagan Arabs.  He knew that Arabs are inherently sex maniacs and wine lovers which are historically true. In the Arab desert environment—water was another most precious commodity which no Arabs could refuse or neglect to get. Prophet Muhammad's clever creation and wishful description of heavenly pleasures (which he also copied from other religions like Zoroastrian and Hinduism) did not miss any of the above most important and most attractive items to lure Bedouin Arabs. In fact, those poor, illiterate, Vagabond Arab Bedouin were simply mesmerized by the incredible lustful description of heavenly houries, wine, foods, and luxurious life style in the heaven.</span></div></p>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"> </span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"><img title="Beduin's Reality" src="https://www.islammonitor.org/uploads/pics/reality.jpg" alt="Beduin's Reality" width="380" height="253" /></span></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Bedouin's reality </strong></span></div>
<div style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">
Most important driving forces behind their craze were war booties: sex with those beautiful young ladies of defeated pagans, wine, and other earthly goods which most Bedouin Arabs could not even dream in their entire life. As a result they were totally fearless fighters and wanted to die in a hurry in order to achieve those incredible heavens in the after life. This was the key factor which brought Prophet Muhammad's victory after victory over the Arab Pagans.
<p>Without a question Prophet Muhammad used his most cunning mindsets to create most dangerous and horrendously cruel punishments in his weird Islamic hells (a separate essay will be written on Islamic hell later) which equally kept all Pagan Arabs totally in panic and subdued.  The fear of hell fire, and unlimited greed for lustful heavenly pleasures were the most important driving force which has kept most pagan Arabs totally tamed to the Prophet Muhammad's wishful mission of establishing Islam. Even today, the same fear of hellfire and greed of lustful heavens are the most important and primary elements (Opium) which is keeping almost 1 Billion human beings not only subdued or numb, but devoid of any norm, or human sense.
