The Bangladesh Rifles are headquartered in the Bangladeshi capital's Pilkhana area.
<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: verdana,geneva;">Officials said that the army has been called in to bring the situation under control.
<p>Nicholas Haque, reporting for Al Jazeera from Dhaka, said there had been heavy fighting since the morning.
 
&quot;The fighting broke out, apparently, this morning during a meeting between junior and senior officers. There is panic on the streets right now. No-one is clear about what's happening,&quot; he said.
 
&quot;They [a suspected paramilitary group] are shooting into civilian crowds around them.... it's a very terrible reminder of what happened years ago when there was a coup.
<strong>
'Mutiny over pay'
</strong>
&quot;Fighting continues in the compound. There is no security, no police, there is no-one outside the compound... there are just civilians... apart from the army pointing their guns towards civilians.&quot;<strong>
</strong>
Private TV stations Bangla Vision and ETV, reporting live from the scene, said the guards came out of their barracks and seized a conference hall where officers were meeting.</p>
<p>The report said troops of the Bangladesh Rifles chanted slogans for more pay and better facilities.</p>
<p>Several bystanders outside the complex were injured and taken to state-run Dhaka Medical College Hospital, ETV reported.</p>
<p>Some of the troops also stormed out of the complex and seized a nearby shopping mall, ETV added.</p>
<p>The fighting occurred a day after Sheikh Hasina, the newly elected prime minister, visited the headquarters and addressed the troops, urging them to become &quot;more disciplined and remain ever ready to guard the country's frontiers&quot;.</p>
<p></span>Bangladesh has had a history of military coups and uprisings.Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first elected president and the father of Hasina, was killed along with several of his family members in 1975.</p>
<p>The country, which secured its independence from Pakistan in 1971, has also experienced long spells of military rule.</div>

<hr /><strong>Mutiny sparks fierce battle in Dhaka, coup denied</strong>
<p>A fierce gun battle broke out on Wednesday inside the headquarters of Bangladesh's border security force in the capital Dhaka after a mutiny by soldiers against their officers, officials said.</p>
<p>At least one person was killed and eight others were injured, medical sources said, as police and regular troops ringed the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles.</p>
<p>&quot;There has been a huge exchange of gunfire at BDR (Bangladesh Rifles) headquarters complex this morning. We have heard mortar fire,&quot; local police chief Nabojit Khisa said.</p>
<p>&quot;The gunfire is still going on. We are not allowed to enter.&quot;</p>
<p>Smoke could be seen coming from the complex, with security forces sealing the area off.</p>
<p>&quot;The army has been called in. They have already started moving to the area,&quot; said Colonel Rezaur Rahman, the deputy chief of Bangladesh's elite internal security force, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).</p>
<p>&quot;RAB officers have also circled the whole compound. But we have not moved in yet. Gunfire can be heard from inside.&quot;</p>
<p>Official sources told AFP that the mutiny coincided with a meeting of senior Bangladesh Rifles officers at the headquarters in Dhaka's Pilkhana area.</p>
<p>But they stressed that the mutiny was the result of a problem within the security force and was not a coup d'etat.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be a mutiny of BDR (paramilitary) troops&quot; against their regular army officers, an armed forces spokesman said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Bangladeshi army called on the BDR troops to &quot;surrender arms and go back to the barracks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The honourable prime minister (Sheikh Hasina) will herself talk to you about your demand. Any soldiers who fail to give up arms after this announcement will be prosecuted,&quot; the statement added.</p>
<p>Dhaka Medical College nurse Khademul Islam said four people have been admitted for treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;At least four people including a BDR soldier have been admitted in the hospital with bullet injuries. Two of them have got bullet injuries in their chest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Since winning independence from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh has had a history of coups and counter-coups.</p>
<p>The grindingly poor country was run by military dictator Hussain Mohammad Ershad from 1982 to 1990, before democracy was restored in 1991.</p>
<p>The army again stepped in in January 2007, cancelling elections and declaring a state of emergency following months of political unrest. Democracy was restored with elections last December.</p>
