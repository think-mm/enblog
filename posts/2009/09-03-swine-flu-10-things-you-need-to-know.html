Latest information says that more than 300 people are already detected as carrying Swine Flu in Bangladesh. Experts opine that the exact number might even be much higher than speculated. Meanwhile, Bangladeshi government is yet to take appropriate measures at all entrance points of the country to check further spread of swine flu. A number of educational institutions have already closed fearing the epidemic spread of this deadly disease.
<p>Bangladesh on August 27, 2009 alerted its citizens about the spread of H1N1 swine flu as authorities reported 87 cases in the country, with the situation in neighbouring India worsening rapidly, officials said.</p>
<p>'It is a matter of concern for us as the situation has turned worse in neighbouring India,' Health Minister Ruhal Haque told reporters after a meeting reviewing the country's latest H1N1 situation.</p>
<p>He asked the authorities concerned for proper screening of inbound passengers from India, especially through the land border crossings.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has 14 land ports in operation with India.</p>
<p>Earlier, the government enhanced vigilance on airports and sea ports introducing special medical desks to detect swine-flue infection. Most of the H1N1 cases were detected at Dhaka's Zia International Airport, officials at the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research said.</p>
<p>The government called on the people not to panic over the situation as it has taken adequate measures to deal with it.</p>
<p>'There is nothing to be panicked about. We consider the situation alarming as the deadly virus was spreading rapidly and widely in neighbouring India, where the death toll from the virus is on the rise,' the minister said, asking the people to take cautionary measures.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight people have reportedly died of the virus in India. The first case of H1N1 infection in Bangladesh was detected on June 19</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p></p>
<div><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">Since it first emerged in April, the global swine flu epidemic has sickened more than 1 million Americans and killed about 500. It's also spread around the world, infecting tens of thousands and killing nearly 2,000.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">This summer, the virus has been surprisingly tenacious in the U.S., refusing to fade away as flu viruses usually do. And health officials predict a surge of cases this fall, perhaps very soon as schools reopen.</span></div>
<span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Garamond;">A White House report from an expert panel suggests that from 30 percent to half the population could catch swine flu during the course of this pandemic and that from 30,000 to 90,000 could die.
<p>So how worried should you be and how do you prepare? The Associated Press has tried to boil down the mass of information into 10 things you should know to be flu-savvy.
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">1. No cause for panic.</span></strong><span style="color: #008000;">
</span>
So far, swine flu isn't much more threatening than regular seasonal flu.</p>
<p>During the few months of this new flu's existence, hospitalizations and deaths from it seem to be lower than the average seen for seasonal flu, and the virus hasn't dramatically mutated. That's what health officials have observed in the Southern Hemisphere where flu season is now winding down.</p>
<p>Still, more people are susceptible to swine flu and U.S. health officials are worried because it hung in so firmly here during the summer — a time of year the flu usually goes away.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>2. Virus tougher on some.</strong>
</span>
Swine flu is more of a threat to certain groups — children under 2, pregnant women, people with health problems like asthma, diabetes and heart disease. Teens and young adults are also more vulnerable to swine flu.</p>
<p>Ordinary, seasonal flu hits older people the hardest, but not swine flu. Scientists think older people may have some immunity from exposure years earlier to viruses similar to swine flu.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>3. Wash your hands often and long.
</strong></span>
Like seasonal flu, swine flu spreads through the coughs and sneezes of people who are sick. Emphasize to children that they should wash with soap and water long enough to finish singing the alphabet song, &quot;Now I know my ABC's...&quot; Also use alcohol-based hand sanitizers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>4. Get the kids vaccinated.
</strong></span>
These groups should be first in line for swine flu shots, especially if vaccine supplies are limited — people 6 months to 24 years old, pregnant women, health care workers.</p>
<p>Also a priority: Parents and caregivers of infants, people with those high-risk medical conditions previously noted.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>5. Get your shots early.</strong>
</span>
Millions of swine flu shots should be available by October. If you are in one of the priority groups, try to get your shot as early as possible.</p>
<p>Check with your doctor or local or state health department about where to do this. Many children should be able to get vaccinated at school. Permission forms will be sent home in advance.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>6. Immunity takes awhile.</strong>
</span>
Even those first in line for shots won't have immunity until around Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>That's because it's likely to take two shots, given three weeks apart, to provide protection. And it takes a week or two after the last shot for the vaccine to take full effect.</p>
<p>The regular seasonal flu shot should be widely available in September. People over 50 are urged to be among the first to get that shot.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>7. Vaccines are being tested.</strong>
</span>
Health officials presume the swine flu vaccine is safe and effective, but they're testing it to make sure.</p>
<p>The federal government has begun studies in eight cities across the country to assess its effectiveness and figure out the best dose. Vaccine makers are doing their own tests as well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>8. Help! Surrounded by swine flu.</strong>
</span>
If an outbreak of swine flu hits your area before you're vaccinated, be extra cautious.</p>
<p>Stay away from public gathering places like malls, sports events and churches. Try to keep your distance from people in general. Keep washing those hands and keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth.
<strong>
<span style="color: #008000;">9. What if you get sick?</span></strong><span style="color: #008000;">
</span>
If you have other health problems or are pregnant and develop flu-like symptoms, call your doctor right away. You may be prescribed Tamiflu or Relenza. These drugs can reduce the severity of swine flu if taken right after symptoms start.</p>
<p>If you develop breathing problems (rapid breathing for kids), pain in your chest, constant vomiting or a fever that keeps rising, go to an emergency room.</p>
<p>Most people, though, should just stay home and rest. Cough into your elbow or shoulder. Stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever breaks. Fluids and pain relievers like Tylenol can help with achiness and fever. Always check with a doctor before giving children any medicines. Adult cold and flu remedies are not for them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>10. No swine flu from barbecue.</strong>
</span>
You can't catch swine flu from pork — or poultry either (even though it recently turned up in turkeys in Chile). Swine flu is not spread by handling meat, whether it's raw or cooked.</p>
