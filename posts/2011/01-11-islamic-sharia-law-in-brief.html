<p>Cynicism of the Islamists to promote barbaric &quot;Sharia-based Islam&quot; in the west is going on uninterrupted due to the utter ignorance of the westerners about Islamic ideology in general, democratic convenience, and also by the &quot;politically correct nonsense&quot; spewed by many western politicians by their selfishness and forceful ignorance about the inherent danger of Islamic Sharia. Many hypocritical western residing Islamists are trying relentlessly to soft-sell Islam through their speeches and write-ups and so called &quot;interfaith nonsense&quot; only to fool the westerners. All these Islamists are portraying Islam being compatible with western values. Using cynicism and soothsaying techniques, they are trying hard to convince the westerners that Islam is democratic, Islam is tolerant of other faiths, Islam encourages the pursuit of religious freedom, etc. They conveniently ignore/hide the fascism in Islam that originated from the primary (Quran) and secondary (Hadith) texts in the form of Sharia (Islamic law). The barbaric laws and rules of Sharia are causing the Muslims to suffer the most. Fact of the matter is, these so called Allah's laws are nothing but the ancient Arab Paganic ruthless tribal social justice which had been cleverly ingrained in Islam and now causing the humanity to suffer.</p>
<p>These Islamists are often bluffing westerners by citing some non-Arab Muslim majority nations such as Bangladesh as the proof that there is no inherent discord between Islam and democracy. Many of these countries are nascent western style democracies and are not governed by Islamic Sharia law at all. Outside Middle East, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has adopted partial Islamic laws and one can see the brutality and barbarism happening there in the name of Islam. To understand Islam, one of the important aspects is to understand the &quot;Sharia law&quot;. I have written this piece to inform the readers about the Sharia law that can only generate brutality, hatred, and nothing but Islamic fascism.</p>
<p><strong>What is Sharia law?</strong></p>
<p>The term &quot;Sharia&quot; (Arabic شريعة Šarīʿa; &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot;) is the sacred law of Islam. Sharia law literally means religious code of life. It is used to refer both to the Islamic system of law and the totality of the Islamic way of life. Sharia guides all aspects of Muslim life including politics, daily routines, foods, clothing, amusements, sports, familial and religious obligations, and financial dealings. Traditional Muslims (all mullahs, Mawlanas, Muftis, and Islamic scholars) who understand the Quran and the Hadith believe that sharia (Islamic law) expresses the highest and best goals for all societies on Earth. It is the &quot;law of Allah&quot; and bound to be the best of all. Because of this ardent belief, devout and fanatical Muslims all over the world are in constant struggle (Jihad) with their ruling Government to establish &quot;Islamic Sharia&quot; as the country's only rule by replacing modern secular democracy (Laws made by human).</p>
<p><strong>Sharia and its origin and sources</strong></p>
<p>The &quot;sharia law&quot; in all the four Madhabs are esentially the same. The principal sources of Sharia are: the <em>Quran, Hadiths, and Sunnah</em> — (the sayings, practices, and teachings of the Prophet Mohammed). The secondary sources are: Ijma (consensus), Kiyas (analogy), Ijtihad (responsible individual opinion), and Istihsan (Juristic references).</p>
<p><strong>There are four main schools of Sharia law</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hanbali</span>:</strong> This is the most conservative school of Shari'a. It is used in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saudi Arabia</span> and some states in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Northern Nigeria</span>. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Maliki</span>:</strong> This is based on the practices of the people of Medina during Muhammad's lifetime. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
Shafi'i:</span></strong> This is a conservative school that emphasizes on the opinions of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hanifi</span>:</strong> This is the most liberal school, and is relatively open to some limited modern ideas.</span>
<p><strong>Brief History of Sharia compilations</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span lang="EN">Muslims consider that, Sharia law was founded on the words of <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single;" title="Allah" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah">Allah</a> as revealed in the Qur'an, and traditions gathered from the life of the Prophet Muhammad.  Sharia continued to undergo fundamental changes, beginning with the reigns of <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single;" title="Caliph" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph">caliphs</a> <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single;" title="Abu Bakr" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> (632–34) and <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single;" title="Umar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umar">Umar</a> (634–44), during which time many questions were brought to the attention of Muhammad's closest comrades for consultation.<sup><a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia#cite_note-Dien.2C_Mawil_Izzi_2004-59#cite_note-Dien.2C_Mawil_Izzi_2004-59">[60]</a></sup> Therefore, Quran and Sunnah were the principle guidance to formulate the core issues of "Islamic Sharia". </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span lang="EN"> </span></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span lang="EN">Although, "Sharia law" principally derived from the emulations of early Islamic rules by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prophet Muhammad and his four rightly guided Caliphs</span> , but<strong> </strong>written format (except some hand-written notes) was not available during the early period of Islamic Caliphates. However, h</span>and-written Sharia formulation was started right from the time of Prophet and continued thereafter during four rightly-guided Caliphs, Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphs until the time of Ottoman Empire. Sharia developed during the long period of: 750-850 CE. Actual Hand-written "Sharia booklets" were formed and compiled by four schools of Islamic scholars and were used by various caliphs as the constitution of the court and final version of the Sharia was compiled after 150 years of the death of Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE. Modern-day Saudi Courts use most conservative Sharia formulated by Imam Hanbali (Hanibali booklet) and Imam Jafri booklet is used in Iran.(Al-Cistani is the guru of Shiite jurisprudence). Actual paper-backed Islamic Sharia books were prepared during 17th Century King Auwrangazev (Alamgir) of Mugal Empire in India. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong><span lang="EN">S</span>ome common laws of "Islamic Sharia" which are regularly practiced in the Islamically ruled (Sharia-based) nations with some minor variations:</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">1- Jihad defined as "to war against all non-Muslims to establish the religion" is the duty of every Muslim and Muslim head of state (Caliph). Muslim Caliphs who refuse jihad are in violation of Sharia and unfit to rule.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">2-  A Caliph can hold office through seizure of power meaning through force.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">3- The head of an Islamic State (Caliph) cannot be charged, let alone be punished for serious crimes such as murder, adultery, robbery, theft, drinking and in some cases of rape (Hudood cases) - Codified Islamic Law Vol 3 # 914C of and page 188 of Hedaya the Hanafi manual. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">4- A percentage of Zakat (alms) must go towards jihad.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">5-  It is obligatory to obey the commands of the Caliph, even if he is unjust.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">6-  A caliph must be a Muslim, a non-slave and a male.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">7-  The Muslim public must remove the Caliph in one case, if he rejects Islam.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">8-  A Muslim who leaves Islam (apostate) must be killed immediately.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">9-  A Muslim will be forgiven for murder of : a) an apostasy b) an adulterer c) a highway robber. Making vigilante street justice and honor killing acceptable.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">10-  A Muslim will not get the death penalty if he kills a non-Muslim.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">11- Sharia never abolished slavery and sexual slavery and highly regulates it. A master will not be punished for killing his slave. Slavery still exists amongst Arab Muslims. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">12-  Sharia dictates death by stoning, beheading, for sins like killing, adultery, prostitutions; and other Quranic corporal punishments like: amputation of limbs (chopping hands and feet), floggings, beatings and other forms of cruel and unusual punishments even for the sins like: stealing, sexual promiscuity, robbery, burglary etc. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">13- Non-Muslims are not equal to Muslims and must comply to Sharia (pay Zizzya: poll tax) if they are to remain safe. They are forbidden to marry Muslim women, publicly display wine or pork, recite their own religious scriptures, or openly celebrate their religious holidays or funerals. They are forbidden from building new churches or building them higher than mosques. They may not enter a mosque without permission. A non-Muslim is no longer protected if he commits adultery with a Muslim woman or if he leads a Muslim away from Islam.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">14-  It is a crime for a non-Muslim to sell weapons to someone who will use them against Muslims. Non-Muslims cannot curse a Muslim, say anything derogatory about Allah, the Prophet, or Islam, or expose the weak points of Muslims. However, Muslims can curse, criticize or say anything derogatory they like to the religions of others.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">15-  A non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">16-  Banks must be Sharia compliant and interest is not allowed.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">17-  No testimony in court is acceptable from people of low-level jobs, such as street sweepers or a bathhouse attendant. Women in such low level jobs such as professional funeral mourners cannot keep custody of their children in case of divorce.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">18-  A non-Muslim cannot rule even over a non-Muslims minority.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">19-  Homosexuality is punishable by death.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">20-  There is no age limit for marriage of girls under Sharia. The marriage contract can take place anytime after birth and consummated at age 8 or 9.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">21- Rebelliousness on the part of the wife nullifies the husband's obligation to support her, gives him permission <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to beat her</span> and keep her from leaving the home.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">22- Divorce is only in the hands of the husband and is as easy as saying: "I divorce you" and becomes effective even if the husband did not intend it.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">23- There is no common property between husband and wife and the husband's property does not automatically go to the wife after his death.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">24- A woman inherits half what a man inherits. Sister gets half of what brother gets. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">25- A man has the right to have up to 4 wives and wife has no right to divorce him even if he is polygamous.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">26- The dowry is given in exchange for the woman's sexual organs.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">27- A man is allowed to have sex with slave women and also with women captured in battle (concubines), and if the enslaved woman is married her marriage is annulled.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">28- The testimony of a woman in court is half the value of a man; that is, two women equal to one man.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">29- A woman looses custody if she remarries.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">30- A rapist may only be required to pay the bride-money (dowry) without marrying the rape victim.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">31- A Muslim woman must cover every inch of her body which is considered "Awrah," a sexual organ. Some schools of Sharia allow the face and some don't.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">32- A Muslim man is forgiven if he kills his wife caught in the act of adultery. However, the opposite is not true for women since he "could be married to the woman he was caught with."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">33-It is obligatory for a Muslim to lie if the purpose is obligatory and is known as <em>Taqiyya </em>(Islamic Deception). That means that for the sake of abiding with Islam's commandments, such as jihad, a Muslim is obliged to lie and should not have any feelings of guilt or shame associated with this kind of lying.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">The above are clear-cut laws in Islam decided by great Imams after years of examination and interpretation of the Quran, Hadith and Mohammed's life. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;">34. The perpetrators of genocide, mass rape and plunder will not be punished if they repent - Codified Islamic Law Vol 1 # 13. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">35. To prove rape, a woman must have 4 male witnesses. Women's testimony is not accepted - Pakistan's Hudood ordnance 7 of 1979 amended by 8B of 1980. Thousands of raped women and girls in many countries have been charged with Zena (physical relations outside marriage) and punished by Sharia courts for want of witnesses. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">36. All modern music including sexually explicit music of any kind is strictly prohibited and punishable by Islamic Sharia code of justice. Only Islamic songs are allowed. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">The above are the most important parts of Islamic Sharia law which were devoutly practiced by the early Islamic rulers (Holy Prophet and his four rightly guided Caliphs) and also by the Caliphs of Ummyad and Abbasid Dynasties ruled from Baghdad (Today's Iraq) and later by Ottoman Empire with very little variations. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Islamic Taqiyya vs. Reality of Islamic Sharia!</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">Caution! Islam permits devout Muslims to lie, cheat, and deliberately bluff non-muslims to protect or promote his religion of Islam, anytime, anywhere. And this tactic is know as "</span><span lang="EN">Islamic Taqiyya</span><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">" (read: <em>Islamic deception</em>), and was originally used by the Prophet of Islam to fool, and later subjugate and destroy enemies of Islam. As Prophet of Islam repeatedly asserted: "</span><span lang="EN">War is a deception</span><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">" and with this holy-tactic, Prophet of Islam established his most intolerant religion of violence (by 80 plus bloody battles) which he later named as: "</span><span lang="EN">religion of peace</span><span style="font-weight: normal;" lang="EN">"! Therefore, today's Islamists will follow the holy path of their Prophet and will deny that—Sharia is really Islamic law! They will try to cheat by saying that, all these Sharia laws that are practiced in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Sudan, and elsewhere <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are not true Islamic</span>, and they have been distorted. They also will try to fool people by saying: Saudi Arabia is ruled by King (Monarch) and Islam does not permit Kingship etc. But, their dishonest assertion is furthest from the truth. Ancient Caliphs of Islam were nothing but the kings of ancient Islamic nations having supreme despotic and dictatorial authoritative rulers. In fact, ancient Islamic caliphs were more despotic and brutal rulers than the present day Saudi King. </span></strong></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">No one should be fooled to believing that these harsh and draconian laws were invented out of any wishful imagination of the so called "Islamic radicals/extremists" who came long after Muhammad. Actually, these harsh and barbarically cruelest laws came directly from the founder of Islam in his Quran and in his example in the hadith. Almost 98% of the above samples of Sharia justice can be traced-backed to Quran and Sunnah positively. In fact, Prophet Muhammad himself actually practiced them and deliberately laid down these corporal punishments and policies to rule the ancient Islamic Caliphate. Modern Kings and Presidents of today's Islamic nations are doing exactly the same to emulate Islamic Prophet and those ancient rightly guided Caliphs. Honorable readers can peruse the article in the reference # 8 to learn more about Islamic Taqiyya. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Some Quranic verses and Hadiths which can be directly attributed for draconian sharia justice: </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span lang="EN-GB">Readers can check following Quranic verses to understand the sources of the corporal punishments as per Sharia Justice:</span>[<strong>Quranic Verses: 4:34, 4:15-16, 24:2. 5:38, 5:45,  5:33, 98:6, 9:111, 9:29, 3:85, 4:89 , 3:90,  4:11-12, 4:176, 8:1, 43:18, 33:61, 4:16-20, 2:282, 2:230, 4:3, 4:11-12, 9:28, 2:96, 9:30, <span style="color: black;">3:28, 16:106-107, 2:223, 8:12-14, 8:65, 47:4, 9:39, 2:96, 9:30, 2:191, 2:216, 48:20, 5:33, 9:73, 3:85, 9:113, 9:80-84, 33:21]</span></strong><span style="color: black;">.For space limitations, it is not possible to cite exact physical verses here; but readers can open the Quran and verify the verse numbers I have provided above only to discover that—these verses  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are the nucleus</span> from which most of the above corporal punishments and practices of Sharia law have been originated. Please mind that, the verse #s I have cited here are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only some examples</span> and never exhaustive of the list. Quran is replete with harsh cruel belligerent verses for unbelievers and violators of Islamic Sharia law which very well be  the real sources of Sharia justice. .</span></span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong><span lang="EN">Government under God and Blasphemy!</span></strong><span lang="EN"> </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span lang="EN">In those Muslim countries where "Islamic Sharia" is the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">official constitution</span>, Quran and Sunnah—(the sayings, practices, and teachings of the Prophet Mohammed) are declared to be the sources of the country's laws. Hence, modern democracy is immediately vanished from the land. Non-muslims are considered second class citizens with very limited rights. Most importantly, citizens in general have no right to criticize anything done by their Government because the rulers only practice God's law and it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blasphemous to criticize God's law</span> and thereby it is strictly prohibited, and punishable by imprisonment or even death. Moreover, <strong>God's laws are immutable hence can never be altered or amended by any means.</strong> That is why all those strict Sharia-based nations can be taken as the true examples of ancient Islamic nations ruled by Islamic caliphates.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Sharia law has been adopted in various forms by many countries, ranging from a strict interpretation in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and northern states of Nigeria, Sudan, al-Qaeda occupied Somalia, to a relatively liberal interpretation in much of Malaysia, Pakistan, Bahrain, Yemen and United Arab Emirates. In those strictly followed Sharia nations such as <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saudi Arabia</span>—women <span lang="EN">are not allowed to drive, can not go out of home alone, remain under the guardianship of male relatives at all times, and must be completely covered in public. For long, women education was totally banned in Saudi Arabia, Iran, and many other Islamic nations.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Sharia in general are heavily misogynistic and anti-minorities. Women and minorities are the prime victims of Islamic Sharia-based nations. Women and all non-muslims live <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as the second class citizens in their own country</span>. Rape cases are almost impossible to prove in the court of Islamic nations. It is quite ridiculous to consider that any rapist will do the crime in front of 4 males to observe and enjoy the scene (sexual orgy) so that they can later give testimony in the court! Therefore, it is highly impossible to prove rape case in the court and rape victims in Islamic nations end up being charged with Zena (physical relations outside marriage) and punished (floggings or stoning death) by Sharia courts for want of witnesses. Very recently, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, a gang raped 13 years old girl was stoned to death on the orders of a Sharia court in the "Sharia Compliant" country named Somalia.  </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span lang="EN">Family matters such as marriage and divorce are the most significant aspects of sharia law practiced in most Muslim nations. Even in the democratically ruled Muslim nations such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Turkey etc, family matters (inheritance, marriage, divorce, and child custody etc) are governed by Sahrai law, still today.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Draconian and barbaric corporal punishments of Hudood law</strong>: </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><span lang="EN">In all Sharia-based nations—criminal laws are practiced only by Sharia-justice. Quranic corporal punishments are known as "<em>Hudood laws</em>". There are five "<em>Hudood</em>" crimes: unlawful sexual intercourse (sex outside of marriage and adultery), false accusation of unlawful sexual intercourse, wine drinking (sometimes extended to include all alcohol drinking), theft, and highway robbery. Punishments for <em>"Hudood</em>" offenses are—flogging, stoning death, beheading, amputation, exile, or execution are routinely practiced in Saudi Arabia and Iran. Honor killings, murders committed in retaliation for bringing dishonor on one's family, are a worldwide problem among the Muslims only. UN estimates thousands of women are killed annually in the <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single;" href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: windowtext;">name of family honor (<em>National Geographic</em>)</span></a>. Other practices that are woven into the sharia debate, such as female genital mutilation, child-marriages, polygamy, and gender-inequality.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Draconian system of Blood Money!</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Islamic Quran (<em>from which Sharia was derived</em>) copied (Plagiarized) draconian code of law from the ancient king Hammurabi King of Babylonia, Mesopotamia (2900 B.C). King Hammarubi's revenge/compensation for killing was: <strong>"<em>life for life, hand for hand, eye for eye, ears for ears, tooth for tooth and wounds equal for</em> <em>equal",</em></strong><em> </em>  and the Islamic Allah's Guidance of compensation in Qur'anic Ayat: <strong>5:45</strong> (Translation byYousuf Ali): <strong><em>"life for life, hand for hand, eye for eye, ear for ear, tooth for tooth and wounds equal for equal." </em></strong>It was from this compensatory concept, the "blood money" was established in Sharia law<strong>. </strong>This draconian compensatory justice system is still practiced in Saudi Arabia (<em>details were published in Wall Street Journal, April 9, 2002</em>). Under this system, if a person has been killed or caused to die by another, the latter has to pay "blood money" or compensation, as follows:</span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">100,000 riyals if the victim is a Muslim man</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">50,000 riyals if a Muslim woman</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">50,000 riyals if a Christian man</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">25,000 riyals if a Christian woman</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">6,666 riyals if a Hindu (or idolater) man</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">3,333 riyals if a Hindu  (or idolater) woman  </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">That is, a Muslim man's life is worth 33 times that of a Hindu woman! </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Islam is utterly supremacist and racist religion on Earth! </strong></span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Devout Muslims do believe that, Islam is the only true religion and all other religions are false and not accepted by the Allah. Therefore, Muslims are the superior human than any other humans on earth. According to Islamic Sharia and Koranic teachings—Christians, Jewish, and all other un-believers (Hindus idolaters etc are the worst) are less humans than Muslims and their rights are not the same as the rights of Muslims. This is the very reason why pure Muslims earnestly believe that—it is the most sacred duty of the Muslims to correct, convert, or killed all non-Muslims/infidels/kaffirs to purify this earth which belongs to only Allah. To this end—Islamic Brother-hood, Hamas, Hizbullah, CAIR, and many other Islamic organizations are doing <em>Taqiyya </em>business, and Talibans and al-Qaeda jihadis are engaged in holy business of armed struggle (Jihad) against all kaffirs of the world in general and against American infidels in particular. </span><span style="font-family: Garamond;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">Muslims consider that Islamic Sharia is the "Law of Allah (God)" which is considered divine and immutable and can never be changed or amended by any means! Hence, Islamic Sharia is still clinging to the ancient 7<sup>th</sup> century barbaric justice system. Because of this fact,  almost anywhere this "Islamic Sharia" is being established as the country's ruling constitution, world can immediately witness exact face of despotic, barbarian, and totalitarian Islamic rule to all of the Islamic nations. Imposed "Sharia law" immediately becomes the true nightmare for the general public. </span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Garamond;">In the modern world—all the Islamically (Sharia-based) ruled nations such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Talibani Afghanistan, Sudan, Northern part of Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, and some other Arab nations are practicing the same Sharia law (mentioned above) with some minor variations country to country, but basics are the same—they all are ruling their nation by Allah's law.  Also, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and some other Arab nations like Kuwait, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Arab Emirate etc are practicing Sharia in variable status country to country. But, main preambles of Sharia law and their sources remain the same. Therefore, all those false claims by most Muslim scholars and Islamic apologists are plain lies and cheating (<em>practicing Islamic Taqiyya</em>) about the ugly face of Sharia-based modern nations such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Sudan or Somalia. All these hypocritical western-living Islamic apologists are hell-bent to destroy western civilization from within. Gullible westerners and politically Correct western politicians should never be fooled by the utter deceptions and lies routinely and deliberately spewed by all the western-living Islamists.  </span></p>
