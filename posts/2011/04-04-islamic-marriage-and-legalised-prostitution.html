<p> The significance of married life is great. Fortunate indeed is that couple who starts married life with right understanding of its importance and greatness. Marriage is a sacred spiritual partnership between two souls who have come upon this earth to evolve an ideal life of nobility, virtue and <em>Dharma</em> (social custom in Hinduism) and attain their goal of divine perfection through such ideal life. Therefore, the home of a married couple is a sanctified centre of spiritual life. The home is their place of worship, prayer and daily meditation. It is truly said that the marriages are made in heaven. Sex is not everything in a marriage.</p>
<p>The home is a sacred arena for the attainment of self-conquest and self-mastery which is more thrilling than conquering a monarchy. Blessed are those couples who lead this divine life, where truth, purity and universal love, mutual trust and compassion constitute the basic foundation of such divine life. Such a house is the abode of God. People may visit such a sacred place for pilgrimage.</p>
<p>In Hinduism, a wedding ceremony at its core is essentially a Vedic <em>yajña </em>(a fire sacrifice), in which the Arian deities are invoked in the ancient Indo-Aryan style. <em>Agni, </em>the fire-deity (or the sacred fire) is the primary witness of a Hindu marriage. By law and tradition, no Hindu marriage is deemed complete unless in the presence of this sacred fire, seven encirclements have been made around it by the bride and the groom together. Divorce is rare amongst Hindus.</p>
<p>In Christianity, the views of marriage historically have regarded marriage as ordained by God for the lifelong union of a man and a woman. The fundamental principal was first articulated Biblically in Genesis 2:24 (<em>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh</em>). Afterwards, Jesus set forth his basic position on marriage by bringing together two important passages from Genesis (1:27; 2:7-- 25). He pointed to the completion of the creation – &quot;<em>male and female he created them</em>&quot;. Then Jesus described marriage as a sacred relationship, a union, so intimate and real that &quot;<em>the two became one flesh</em>&quot;. As persons, husband and wife are of equal value. In truth, they are one.</p>
<p>Then what about Islam and Muslims?</p>
<p>Well, some hopeless pessimists had observed that marriage is a legalized prostitution. This exactly defines the 'holiness' of Muslim marriage and the status of married women under Islam. In Islam, through marriage, a man takes the rightful ownership of the 'meat' of a woman's body. Unlike Hinduism and Christianity, marriage is not a binding union in Islam. Here, the idea of association, partnership, or companionship between the married couple is completely absent. The Koran does not view divorce or separation as a tragic option but provide a golden opportunity for man to replace his wife. In Islam, women have no mind, only the 'meat' of her body is '<em>halal</em>' for man to enjoy. As per <em>Shahih Bukhari</em> 7.62.173, <strong>Wife must shave her pubic hair</strong> if husband returns home at night after a long journey.</p>
<p><em>Nasrin </em>(2007) lamented, &quot;<em>My mother used 'purdah'. She wore a 'burqa' with a net cover in front of the face. It reminded me of the meat-safes in my grandmother's house. One had a net door made of cloth, the other of metal. But the objective was same – keeping the meat safe</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>During Muhammad and his successors, prostitution diminished for a time (<em>Durant, 1950. p. 220</em>). It's not because Muhammad had a high regard for women and he worked for the welfare of the fallen women and upgraded their condition. It's because Muhammad lowered the status of married women to the lowest level of sex-slavery and prostitution. He allowed sexual appetite so many outlets within the Islamic law that the prostitutes became jobless. The shocking truth is that Muhammad viewed women as domestic animals. In his farewell sermon Muhammad equated women to cattle. <em>Tabari </em>(IX:113) recorded (<em>cited Winn, 2004, p. 557</em>) &quot;<em>Treat women well for they are like <strong>domestic animals</strong> and they possess <strong>nothing</strong> themselves. Allah has made the <strong>enjoyment of their bodies lawful in his Qur'an.</strong></em>&quot; As per <em>Sunaan Abu Dawud</em> 11.2155; <strong>Women, slaves and camels are same</strong>; must seek Allah's refuge from all these. Muhammad's teaching was too great. During 2007, a man (of forty years) from Afghanistan first shaved his wife <em>Nazia</em>'s (of seventeen years) head and then cut off her ears, and nose and broke her teeth with a stone, knocked her down and beat her severely until her hands and legs were broken and burnt her feet with boiling water while she fainted, on the first day of <em>Eid ul Adha</em>, an Islamic ritual of sacrifice. <em>Nazia</em> is his second wife. He already killed his first wife. (<em>Hairan, </em><em>2007; IRIN, 2007</em>). This is how some Muslims celebrate <em>Eid</em> festival; sacrificing own wife in place of a camel. Camels are costly but women are cheap. In Afghanistan, the husband usually sleeps with all the four wives in the same bed and enjoys sex in full view of non-participant wives.</p>
<p>In Urdu, women are called '<em>aurat</em>' (عور<em>ت</em>)<em>,</em><em> </em>which came from the Arabic word '<em>awrah</em>' (عورة).<em> </em>The Arabic word refers to the genitals of a woman's body, in a simple and straightforward word, which is called the 'vagina'. It means, the entire body of a Muslim woman is a huge vagina and nothing else (<em>Warraq, 2005. p. 316</em>). How many Urdu speaking Asian Muslims know this fact that for referring their mothers, sisters and daughters, they use a word which actually degrades their women folks?</p>
<p>'<em>Nikah</em>' (Muslim marriage, النكاح) is an Arabic word whose literal meaning is penetration (<em>Kaleeby, 2002; Warraq, 2005</em>). It can be pronounced as '<em>Nokh</em>', which again means the '<em>awrah</em>', the giant vagina, i.e, the entire body of a Muslim woman. When the word '<em>Nikah</em>' is used to mean marriage, the actual meaning is not marriage but literally 'sexual penetration'. Ignorant Muslims often use these words, without knowing their actual meaning and degrade their woman folks to the level of sex-slaves and cheap highway prostitutes.</p>
<p><em>Kasem </em>(n. d) concluded that the method of securing such sexual / physical pleasure is very similar to a commercial / business transaction. In plain language, this is called prostitution. In all cases of marriage and sex, the women are treated merely as sex-objects, much like the provider of a service for which she must be paid some compensation. </p>
<p>The compensation (dower) for sexual service of the wife is known as '<em>mahr</em>', which all Muslim men must agree to pay before marriage. It can be immediate or deferred to a future date. No Islamic marriage is valid without the payment of '<em>mahr</em>'. Sometimes, Muslim women take keen pride in the sums paid for them as '<em>mahr</em>' without knowing the actual purpose of it. In reality, however, '<em>mahr</em>' is nothing but the payment to purchase a female body for sexual enjoyment.<em> </em>This degradation is sanctioned by Allah in '<em>Sha'ria</em>' (the divine law of Allah). So when a Muslim marries off his sister or daughter to another Muslim family, he actually auctions his sister's or daughter's soft and warm vagina for a quick financial profit. If the '<em>mahr</em>' is not sufficient, then as per '<em>Sha'ria</em>' Law, the marriage can be cancelled. Often the wife does not get to use the '<em>mahr</em>' for herself. This money is used to furnish the house of the newly married couple or her father grabs the entire amount (<em>Warraq, 2005, p. 311</em>). In an Islamic marriage, there is hardly a trace of romantic love. One rarely finds love poetry in their marriage songs.</p>
<p><em>Kasem</em> (n. d) furthermore lamented taking reference from an authentic '<em>Sha'ria</em>' Law book, that the husband's rights include but not limited to '<em>…ownership of a woman's body to do as he likes including beating… a husband possesses full right to enjoy his wife's person (from top of her head to the bottom of her feet!) in what does not physically harm her… he is entitled to take her with him when he travels.'</em> Under <em>Sha'ria</em> Law, the husband is not obliged to pay for her medical expenses in case of illness except childbirth (<em>Warraq, 2005. p. 311</em>).</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Besides above, <em>Kasem</em> (n. d) continued by taking reference from another book '<em>The Hedaya Commentary on the Islamic Laws'.</em> This book is frequently used by <em>Sha'ria </em>lawyers in the interpretation of Islamic laws. It says, <em>&quot;…full dower is the payment for the delivery of woman's person, '<strong>Booza</strong>', meaning </em>'<strong><em>Genitalia arvum Mulieris</em></strong><em>' </em>&quot;  </p>
<p><em>Kasem</em> (n.d) with disgust concluded, &quot;<em>Yes, you read it correctly. The meaning of </em>'<strong><em>Genitalia arvum Mulieris' </em></strong><em>is<strong> </strong>woman's vagina. The above few sentences clearly meant that <strong>a woman sells her vagina in return for the dower</strong>. This is a commercial transaction. Make no mistake about it! Period.'</em>'</p>
<p>Though <em>Kasem</em> was blunt in his statement, but truly the Islamic Holy Scripture <em>Al-Hadis </em>is in agreement with him. As per <em>Mishkat al-Masabih</em>, &quot;<em>A woman is like a private part. When she goes out the devil casts a glance at her</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>The divine law of Allah, <em>Sha'ria</em>, does not recognize 'forced sex' on women after marriage. There is nothing called marital rape. Once '<em>mahr</em>' is paid, the wife is a legal sex-slave of the man (often next to three other equally helpless wives). In prostitution, a customer does not need to bother about the sexual gratification of the prostitute. Similarly, the sexual desires and preferences of the women are not recognized in Islam. Marital rape incidents are too high in Bangladesh, as <em>Azad (1995, p. 240) </em>lamented, &quot;<em>For a woman, the first night after marriage is the night of forcible sex. In Bangladesh, the number of marital rape incidents is several times higher than any other rapes</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <em>Azad</em> (<em>1995, p. 248</em>) again lamented, &quot;<em>Here [Bangladesh], there are single rapes and multiple rapes. Here; father rapes daughter, son-in-law rapes mother-in-law … top executive rapes sweeper of his office, teacher rapes girl student, Imam rapes the kindergarten girl, brother-in-law rapes the sister-in-law, father-in-law rapes daughter-in-law…&quot;[original in Bengali, translated by author]</em>.</p>
<p>Islam's attitude towards women can better be understood from a sixteenth century treatise, <em>The perfumed garden </em>by<em> Shaykh Nefzawi</em>. &quot;<em>Do you know <strong>women's religion is in their vaginas</strong>?&quot; </em> <em>Nefzawi</em> asked<em>, &quot;they are insatiable as per as their vulvas are concerned, and so long as their lust is satisfied they do not care whether it is a buffoon, a negro, a valet, or even a despised man<strong>. It is Satan, who makes the juices flow from their vaginas</strong></em>&quot; (<em>cited Warraq, </em><em>1995. p. 290</em>).</p>
<p><em>Sha'ria</em> Law permits temporary marriages (<em>Nikah Mutah</em>), though there is a Hadith which prohibits it. <em>Mutah</em> marriage is a type of prostitution in the guise of marriage. Dictionary of Islam defines <em>Mutah</em> as '<em>a marriage contracted for a limited period, for a certain sum of money'</em> (<em>cited Brahmachari, 2008</em>). Though Sunni Muslims have banned <em>Mutah</em>, but it is still widely practiced amongst <em>Shias</em>. Under this system, a Muslim can change his wife everyday. It's a temporary permit for sexual service and hence a legalized prostitution.</p>
<p>In <em>Hyderabad</em>, a mega-city of India; the <em>Mullahs </em>and<em> Maulvies</em> work as pimps for old Arabs and arrange <em>Mutah</em> marriages (for duration of 15 – 30 days) with the young Muslim girls. After satisfying their lust using these poor Muslim girls and enjoying the Indian hospitality, these heavily rich but morally bankrupt Arabs divorce (Islamic divorce - triple <em>talaq</em>) the girls after robbing them of their virginity and respect and return to their lands as respectable grand-fathers and fathers. In one incident, an old man named <em>Muhammad Zafer Yaqub Hassan al Jorani</em> from<em> Sharjah </em>married <em>Haseena Begum</em>; a 19 year old girl on May 7, 2004 and after two days divorced her. Again on May 24, he married another 16 year old girl <em>Ruksana Begum</em>. <em>Haseena</em>, reported the matter to police and the culprit was arrested together with the shameless <em>Mullah</em>-pimp <em>Shamsuddin</em> who received 40,000 Indian rupees from <em>Jorani</em>. <em>Jorani</em> already had two wives and 11 children back home. As per another report published on <em>Hindu-Voice</em> January 2007 issue (<em>cited Brahmachari, 2008</em>), a 60 year old rich Arab married 3 girls, <em>Afreen, Farheena </em>and<em> Sultana</em>, at a single sitting within ten minutes in <em>Hyderabad</em>.</p>
<p>There are about 35 to 40 reported fake marriages occur every year between rich Arabs and young Indian Muslim girls in <em>Hyderabad</em>. The actual figure is much higher. In fact, the <em>Mullahs</em> start chasing these Arabs right at the International airport of <em>Hyderabad</em>. As soon as an Arab lands at the airport, the <em>Mullah </em>pimps target him and the negotiation starts then and there. Photographs of young girls are shown, financial matters are settled and date and place for such marriages are finalized. It's a big racket. Their shameful acts remain unknown to their own daughters and grand daughters of equal age back home. What is disturbing is that these Arabs are even rented out rooms made conveniently in the homes of these <em>Maulvies</em> who perform these fake marriages. In some cases these Islamic marriages last only 24 hours (<em>Sheikh, </em><em>2005</em>). This is how, using Islam, the <em>Mullahs</em> are promoting Islamic prostitution and filling up their pockets with money. <em>Majhar Hussain</em>, the president of the <em>Confederation of Voluntary Agencies</em> said, &quot;<strong><em>This [Mutah marriage] is turning the young Muslim girls into prostitutes</em></strong>&quot;. (<em>cited Brahmachari, 2008</em>). If this practice keeps on going unabated and these <em>Mullahs</em> are not stopped, then very soon <em>Hyderabad</em> might become the centre of legalized, <em>Sha'ria</em>-approved Islamic whore city, another 'Brothel Mecca' of fornication sought by Muslim men mostly from the Arab world. Many Muslims will be seen coming to India for Sex-Hajj (i.e, Islamic sex pilgrimage). Once there is<em> </em>shortage of young virgin girls, <em>Mullahs</em> will probably look for young Muslim housewives to carry on the prostitution.</p>
<p>How many Indian Muslims know these <em>Mullah</em> activities in <em>Hyderabad</em> ? The tragedy is that, <em>Mullahs,</em> the 'keepers' of Islam are also the biggest 'exploiters' of Islam. <em>Mullahs</em> make money at the cost of the pride of common Muslim's daughters and sisters.</p>
<p>In Islam, even the breast-milk of a woman does not belong to her and the husband (who purchased her with '<em>mahr</em>') has the lawful right on it. If the adult husband forcefully drinks the milk of his wife under '<em>Sha'ria</em>', the milk is treated as a food and not as foster milk. According to <em>Malik's Muwatta </em>(<em>Book </em><em>30</em><em>, Number </em><em>30.1.11</em>),<em> </em>&quot;<em>Suckling…after the first two years, little or much, <strong>it does not make anything haram.</strong> <strong>It is like food</strong></em>.&quot; As per another Hadith from <em>Malik's Muwatta </em>(<em>Book </em><em>30</em><em>, Number </em><em>30.2.14),</em> a Muslim man is divinely allowed to drink his wife's milk (or, multiple wives' milk on choice and test) regularly and still can remain her sex-partner (<em>Truly, a Muslim has a lot of advantages over non-Muslims!</em>). This is the height of stupidity in Allah's divine law.</p>
<p>Few years ago AIMPLB (All India Muslim Personal Law Board) had formulated the Muslim marriage law. But there were no woman in the board (<em>Sheikh, </em><em>2005</em>). In a civilized society, this is unthinkable but in Muslim world it is natural. The &quot;<em>halal meat</em>&quot; of a woman's body has no individuality, no identity of its own.</p>
<p>As per <em>Sha'ria</em>, a woman can be married at any age even when she is a newly born baby. <em>Khomeini</em> said &quot;<em>A man can have sexual pleasure from a child as young as a baby</em>&quot; (<em>Paz, 2</em><em>006</em>). What Khomeini said was ethically wrong but islamically divine. Muhammad, the master of darkness was a sex-maniac. Much had been written about his superb collection of wives (which includes baby <em>Aisha</em> and daughter-in-law <em>Zainab</em>), slave-girls and concubines. The lesser known fact is that, once he was sexually attracted to a crawling baby also. <em>Ibn Ishaq</em>, the earliest and most authentic biographer of the prophet recorded in his book <em>Sirat Rasul Allah.</em></p>
<p>&quot;…<em>the apostle saw her (Ummu'l-Fadl) when she was baby crawling before him and said, 'If she grows up and I am still alive I will marry her.' But he died before she grew up</em>…&quot;</p>
<p><em>Umar</em> (<em>Khulafa Rashedin</em>, the rightly guided Caliph) followed Muhammad's footsteps and married <em>Umm Kulthum</em>, the four years old half-sister of <em>Aisha</em>. This is the divinity of Islam. If both Prophet and Caliph are abnormal, how can we blame <em>Khomeini</em> ? Encouraging child marriage is same as advocating child prostitution.</p>
<p>Polygamy is allowed in Koran (4:3). A Muslim can take maximum four wives a time. In India, the Mughal emperor <em>Akbar'</em>s foster brother <em>Mirza Aziz</em> had a brilliant explanation as to why a man needed four wives. '<em>A man must marry one woman of Hindustan to rear up children, one wife from Khurasan to do the household work, one woman from Iran to keep company and talk'. </em>And the fourth<em> </em>? '<em>Why? One woman from Transoxiana to whip the other three and keep peace'(Early, 1977 p. 666). Al-Ghazali</em> advices to all Muslims, &quot;<em>If one woman does not suffice, take some more (up to four). If still you have not found peace, change them</em>&quot;.<em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>The laxity in the number of wives and concubines, and freedom of men to marry and remarry, marriage within close relatives <em>etc</em> often make Muslim families to proliferate confusingly. So, when little <em>Munawwar Ali</em> goes to Madrassah for Islamic education; his best identity is; he is one of the twenty children by one of the thirteen wives of <em>Sheikh Abdullah Ali</em>!  Large family is one of the reasons for which bulk of the Muslims are poor.  <em> </em>   </p>
<p>Throughout the history, Muslim rulers used to have a closely guarded wing called '<em>harem</em>'. In Arabic a '<em>harem</em>' is a prohibited place where all the '<em>begums</em>' (wives) live – vacuum-sealed world of their own. In plain language these <em>harems</em> are private brothels. In India, the Mughal <em>harem</em> was an immense establishment.</p>
<p><em>Akbar</em>, the Mughal Emperor had more than 5000 women (<em>Early, 1977. p. 642</em>). Out of this, his private wives numbered only 300 and rest all was concubines. His son <em>Jahangir</em> had more than 1000 wives (<em>Pelsaert, 1972</em>). <em>Ali</em> had 200 wives. <em>Ibn al-Teiyib</em> , a famous dyer of Baghdad, who lived to be 85 years, is reported to have 900 wives, <em>al-Mutawakkil</em> had 400 wives – each of whom had shared his bed one night only (<em>Durant, 1950, p. 222</em>). Muhammad's grandson <em>Hasan</em> had up to 300 wives. <em>Hasan</em> often married four wives in one sitting and then divorced four wives in one sitting (<em>Kasem, n. d</em>). Muslims have no respect for celibacy. Most Muslim saints are married with a houseful of kids. <em>Durant</em> (<em>1950, p. 220</em>) commented, '<em>Perhaps Islam erred in the opposite direction, and carried marriage to the extreme</em>'.</p>
<p><em>Abul Fazl,(cited Early, 1977 p. 643)</em> had an excellent reason for the support of polygamy  - '<em>Just as for other people more than one wife is not suitable, so for great persons more are necessary, so that their dwellings may be more splendid, and a large number people may be supported</em>.'<em> </em></p>
<p>Now the question is, how these people did manage to have so many wives, when only four are sanctioned to each of them. It is very simple, only a little manipulation is required. Allah said in Koran (4:3), &quot;<em>Marry what seems good to you of women, by twos, threes or fours&quot;. </em>This statement was interpreted in different ways by different Koranic scholars – one scholar added two, three and four and got nine wives. Another got a total of 18 wives by doubling two, three and four and added the results<em> (Eraly, </em><em>1977. p. 666)</em>. Since, in Islam there is no shortage of Koranic scholars, there are many interpretations when fat incentives are given. This is how the number of women in private <em>harems</em> increased.</p>
<p>In the orthodox Muslim families in Middle Eastern countries, the father or the brother might marry off the woman to whomever he wished before she became of age. Love marriages are generally unheard of and prohibited, because in a love-match the villainous man gets too much for nothing. Girls are usually married by the age of twelve, and are mothers at the age of thirteen or fourteen (<em>Durant, 1950; p. 220</em>). Often the groom is not allowed to see the face of his bride before marriage. There are parties, fisting and prayers. After many ceremonies, the husband in privacy of the bridal chamber drew aside of the veil of his wife and pray, &quot;<em>In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful….&quot;.</em> If this belated examination left the groom dissatisfied, he might at once send his wife back to her parents with dowry and search for another bride (<em>Durant, 1950; p. 220</em>).</p>
<p>In general, women have no meaningful life (the situation is not much changed since the time of Muhammad) of their own in Islam. Even at the lowest stratum of society, where gender inequality has little meaning, their life is bleaker than men. Wretchedly poor and undernourished, their health is broken by intermittent childbearing, weighed down by endless drudgery, often in addition to work alongside their men in the field, there was not much more to their lives than bare existence. In Afghanistan and in Bangladesh, more than half of the teenage girls are married. In Iran, Girls often get married when they are only nine (<em>Spencer, 2005</em>). In Bangladesh, 59 percent girls suffer from malnutrition and 10 percent girls suffer from acute malnutrition. (<em>UNDP, 1995</em>).</p>
<p>Even for the middle-class and upper-class Muslim women the situation is same, as <em>Manucci</em> (1989) observed &quot;<em>they [Muslim women] had no cultural interest beyond their blind and routine devotions, had no social life outside the circle of their extended families, no role in the society</em>&quot;</p>
<p>The education of girls, in most ranks of the population, seldom went beyond learning their prayers, a few chapters of the Koran and the arts of home (<em>Durant, 1950; p 221</em>). Liberation of women and education is seen as a threat to male dominance. <em>Omar</em>, the second Caliph said, '<em>Prevent the women from learning to write! Say no to their capricious ways</em>'. And again '<strong><em>Impose nudity on women</em></strong><em>, because cloths are one reason for leaving the house</em>' (<em>Warraq, 2005, p 299</em>). Elsewhere <em>Durant </em>(1950) lamented, &quot;<em>her winsome childhood earned a few years of love, but at seven or eight she was married off to any youth of the clan whose father would offer the purchase price for the bride … she formed the part of the estate of her father, her husband, or her son and was bequeathed with it; she was always the servant, rarely the comrade, of the man. He demanded many children of her, or rather many sons; her duty was to produce warriors. She was in many cases, but one of his many wives. He could dismiss of her at any time at will.</em>&quot; In Pakistan, Islamic fundamentalists are too opposed to education of women. In one lawless five-day period in February, 2004; the fundamentalists burnt down eight girls schools (<em>Spencer, 2005</em>). The <em>Mullahs</em> in <em>Pakistan</em>, while addressing rebellious women in <em>Rawalpindi</em> cautioned, &quot;<em>Let these women be warned, we will tear them to pieces. We will give them such terrible punishments that no one in the future will dare to raise a voice against Islam.</em>&quot; (<em>cited Warraq, 2005. p. 321</em>)</p>
<p>Some medieval theologians thought that Muhammad had invented polygamy, but it is not true, because it antedated Islam by some years (<em>Durant, 1954; p. 39</em>). Muhammad legalized polygamy in his newly established religion and lowered the status of women to the level of prostitutes with divine sanction. As <em>Ascha</em> (1989) concluded, &quot;<em>Islam is the fundamental cause of the repression of the Muslim women and remains the major obstacle to the evolution of their position.</em>&quot;</p>
<p>In cultures that permit polygamy, the youngest co-wife is required to care for elder co-wives. This relationship is sometimes a daughter/mother relationship, but in many cases the elder wives view the younger with bitterness and resentment. In many polygamous relationships, the child bride is treated as an unpaid servant and may never succeed in earning the respect of the elder wives or their children.</p>
<p>In addition to above; domestic violence is the most widespread and common form of violence against women and young girls in Muslim families. Child brides live with older men who expect them to carry out all the duties of an adult woman, even if those responsibilities are too great for a child, let alone a woman. Frequently, the husbands assert their authority in the home through physical violence and consider wife torture a heroic deed. In Egypt twenty-nine percent of married adolescents have been beaten by their husbands; out of this forty-one percent during pregnancy. In Jordan, twenty-six percent of reported cases of domestic violence were committed against wives under eighteen. As per one report by Amnesty International; over ninety percent of Pakistani wives have been mishandled (struck, beaten, or abused sexually) for minor offences like cooking unsatisfactory meal and failure to give birth of a male child (<em>Spencer, 2005</em>). Wife beating is sanctioned by Allah (Koran 4:34). In a Hadith Muhammad advised, &quot;<em>Hang up your whip where your wife can see it</em>&quot; (<em>cited Warraq, 2005. p. 314</em>). In Sudan, the genital passage of the divorced women and widows are closed by stitching keeping a small portion open for menses (<em>Azad, 2005. p. 197</em>).   </p>
<p>Even Muhammad raised his violent hand on his child bride, <em>Aisha</em>. It is recorded in <em>Sahih Muslim,</em> <em>B</em><em>ook 004, </em><em>number 2127</em> (<em>cited Kasem, 2005</em>) – once while sleeping with <em>Aisha</em>, Muhammad secretly left his bed and went to the graveyard at <em>Baqi</em>; <em>Aisha</em> spied and followed Muhammad; when Muhammad learned <em>Aisha</em>'s misdeed he hit her (beat her) on her chest that caused much pain to her. This divine act of wife-beating is recorded in <em>The History of al-Tabari</em>. <em>Vol. IX</em>, (<em>cited Kasem, 2005</em>). However, the 'kind' treatment of women does not end here. <em>Kasem</em> (2005) cited another Hadith from <em>Sunaan Abu Dawud</em> (11.2142) – '<strong><em>The Prophet said: A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife'</em></strong><em>.</em> Somalia Muslims whip their newly wedded wives on the very first night (<em>Azad, 1995. p. 197; Miles, 1988. p. 89</em>). Merciless beating without any reason is a religious tradition in Somalia. <em>  </em></p>
<p><em>Fajlur Rahaman</em> referred to one Hadith (<em>cited Azad, 1995. p. 166</em>), which says &quot;<strong><em>even if the husband is a leper and the wife cleans the pus of his wounds with her tongue and swallows the pus, still she is not equal to her husband</em></strong><em>&quot; (original in Bengali, translated by author)</em>.</p>
<p>In pre-Islamic Arabia women were free, happy and respectful. They used to take part in meetings, often attended in court of law with similar equality of man; run business (<em>Khadija</em>, the first wife of Muhammad was a business women and employed several men to look after her business); even fought many battles. Only under Islam they were animalized.</p>
<p>So, this is the status of married women under Islam. No doubt, a comparison of a legally married woman with prostitutes is unethical and of bad taste. It does not reflect well on the author. But, this article is not the product of a sick mind. Every bit of information on this article is true and taken from authentic sources. On the other hand, Muhammad's and his followers 'high regard' for women points to the only conclusion that Islam cannot be a God approved religion. It is because; high status and respect of women and responsibility of a married couple towards each other, to the family and to the society in general; as taught in Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism and other established religions; is totally absent in Islam. The plain truth is that, the God of Islam is an invented God. This God is actually a puppet and his only purpose is to legalize any crime in the name of religion. And, no doubt, this God is doing well in his job, ever since it was invented.</p>
<p>In general a Muslim's attitude towards 'sex' is almost same as that of an animal. Marriage is never a sacrament with him; it is frankly a commercial transaction. It never occurs to him to be ashamed that he treats women as prostitutes or animals; he would rather be ashamed of the opposite.</p>
<p>In Islamic nations, much of the married women's work remains unrecognized and unvalued. Women are constantly under the threat of divorce (<em>Azad, 1995</em>). Often they don't get enough food to eat from their husbands. In Bangladesh, seventy-seven percent of married women from middle income households and more than ninety-five percent of those from low income households are underweight and malnourished (<em>UNDP, 1995</em>). On top of this, their contribution to the family often goes unnoticed. In Sudan, the time spent for gathering fuel wood has increased fourfold in a decade, which is the duty of a woman. In Mozambique, women spent more than fifteen hours a week just for collecting water for the family (<em>UNPD, 1995</em>). Some Afghani women are compelled to go for grazing around the mountain valleys looking for a blade of grass to feed themselves and their children (<em>Sina, 2001</em>). A recent UN report disclosed that women in Saudi Arabia are the victims of systematic and pervasive discrimination across all aspects of social life (<em>Times, 2008</em>). In Islamic nations, more girls than boys die at young age. Birth of a girl is still seen as a disaster in Muslim societies. Women, who constitute half the global population, definitely deserve a better deal.</p>
<p>Islam seeks power, promotes hate and domination in the name of an imaginary God. In a civilized society, charity begins at home, but in Islamic society; hate and domination begin at home. Probably prostitutes are in a better position than those helpless 'animals' called 'Muslim women'. The greatest task of moral is always sexual regulation. A sense of family value is observed amongst many animals also. Mother is the first '<em>Guru</em>' (spiritual guide) for a child. The child learns the alphabet from his mother. The child learns to speak from his mother. She may make him a saint or a ruler or a rogue. She imparts her virtues to her child with her milk. No society can progress unless their women folks are educated and free. Muslim women should be given education and liberty and then they will bring the required revisions for their betterment. No need for so-called intellectual Muslims to shed endless crocodile tears to try to fool the civilized world. It's a pity that the Muslims are too spiritually deprived to ever realize this fact.</p>
