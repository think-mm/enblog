<p>By, Sujit Das</p>
<p>[<strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> The central theme of this article is taken from Darrel W. Ray's book <em>The God Virus: How Religion Infects Our Lives and Culture.</em>]</p>
<p>There are thousands of examples in popular science fictions of invading aliens taking over mind and bodies of the humans to further their own end, as example, the famous novel by Robert Heinlein <em>The Puppet Masters</em> and the movie by the same title (1994) directed by Stuart Orme, and also another movie <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> (1956) based on a novel <em>The Body Snatchers</em> by Jack Finney (Kay, 2008, p. 330). These two heart-pounding horror films often leave the audience wondering: where did science fiction get the idea?</p>
<p>Fiction cannot be stranger than truth. In the biology of pathogens, parasites and viruses; there are many examples of such infections. Certain parasites can literally take over parts of the brain and control the host by reprogramming the organism in the best interest of parasite and to the determent of the host (Alford &amp; Hill, 2000, p. 82).</p>
<p>Muslims are infected by the deadly Allah virus in the same manner. The parasitic viruses program the host to replicate the virus. The Allah virus activates some programs for replication in the Muslims. Certain behaviors are programmed to ensure that the Allah virus is passed onto others specially their children.</p>
<p>The prime infection strategy of Allah virus, <em>i.e.,</em> Islamization of the Muslim mind starts from the birth and continues throughout his/her life. It is the most extensive brainwashing process a human can ever be subjected to. After birth, an adult holds the newborn and recites the azan (the call for prayers) directly into ears of the baby. This way, the newborn hears the blessed names of Allah and Muhammad before he hears anything else. As the child grows up, he reads and hears more about Qur'an. He sees people performing prayers and walls are decorated with posters of Arabic calligraphy of some Qur'anic verses. He also hears the azan repeated five times a day in every mosque in the area. The call for prayers soon becomes the most frequently heard sound by him. His ears soon get used to hearing the endless recitations of the Qur'an that go on almost continuously.</p>
<p>If the child goes to Madrassah (Islamic school), further indoctrination continues. The fear of Allah, the hate of Allah towards infidels, Muslims are best of people (Q: 3.110) and unbelievers are vilest of created beings (Q: 98.6), Paradise and Hell-fire etc are systematically programmed in him. This is coupled with illogical thoughts and twisted logic to make the child to believe that Muhammad is the best man Allah ever created, or will ever create to the end of time and Allah (like the Big Brother) is watching every Muslim and he should behave strictly according to Allah's will. The fear factor starts working and soon the innocent mind of the child gets the message that there is something very special about the Qur'an, which he is destined to read hundreds of times without ever understanding it and, except Allah no other God to be worshipped.</p>
<p>Once fully indoctrinated, the child fails in his 'reality test' - the ability to distinguish the actual from the imagined. Neither he can confront the truth nor can he admit it even to himself. His sick mind fervently believes in Allah's mercy, power, hell, paradise etc. Slowly; Islam becomes his drug and Allah becomes his addiction. Without Islam, it is a world of black and white. With Islam it is a colorful show complete with drama, thrills, fun and full of excitement. Now he is in the mental prison of Allah. He simply cannot dare to cross the narrow limits specified by Allah. Now he can see things only through the spectacles of Islam. This continues for throughout his life.</p>
<p>A parasitic virus creates antibodies or strong defenses against other viruses (Sompayrac, 2002, p. 14). When Allah virus infects a person (a &quot;host&quot; in biological terms), it immediately begins creating &quot;antibodies&quot; against other competing religions. Any verbal denial of any principle of Muslim belief is considered apostasy. Muslim nations have enacted laws to stop the conversion of the Muslims to other religions. Allah instructed,</p>
<p>&quot;<em>If anyone desires a religion other than Islam (submission to Allah), never will it be accepted of him; and in the Hereafter He will be in the ranks of those who have lost (All spiritual good)</em>&quot; (Q: 3.85)</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will)&quot; </em>(Q: 3.19).</p>
<p><em>&quot;Whosoever disbelieves in Allah after believing except he who is forced while his heart remains in his belief but he who opens his chest for disbelief, shall receive the Anger of Allah and for such awaits a mighty punishment&quot; </em>(Q: 16.106).</p>
<p><em>&quot;… take them (apostates) and kill them wherever you find them. Do not take them for guides or helpers&quot; </em>(Q: 4.89).<em></em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Say: 'Flight will not avail you (apostates), if you flee from death or slaughter, you would enjoy (this world) only for a little (time)'.&quot; </em>(Q: 33.15, 16)</p>
<p>The Allah virus ensures that Muslims get absolute immunity from other religions. In the present society where people of different race, color and religion are expected to live together, it is important. Since the Allah virus cannot control the Muslims from coming in contact in day-to-day life, so it takes preventive measures to keep the Muslims blind and unreceptive to other human beings. Allah has isolated the Muslims from the rest of the human society by dividing the Humankind into two perpetually hostile groups Dar al-Islam (the house of Islam), and Dar al-harb (the house of war), <em>i.e.,</em> Muslims and Kafirs, and has implanted the concept of jihad in the minds of the Muslims. Deprived of contact with others and starved for human interactions, the Muslims bond with their predator. The more helpless a Muslim is, the more he is a dependant on the Allah virus.</p>
<p>The parasitic viruses take over certain mental and physical functions and hide itself within the individual in such a way that it is not detectable by the individual. When a normal healthy human being is infected by Allah virus, his attitude towards others and worldview significantly changes. He, willingly and submissively, self-denigrates to become a partner of Arab imperialism.</p>
<p>This tendency has a devastating affect on the national character of the non-Arab Muslims. When a non-Arab person accepts Islam, he is forced to love Arabia and its traditions at the expense of the culture, honor and pride of his own motherland. Mecca is now more favorite than his birthplace, Arabic more than his mother-tongue and the Arab heroes more than the heroes of his nation. Since Allah hates the infidels, a non-Arab Muslim must hate his own people of his own nation who are following the faith of their ancestors. Some viruses take over the machinery of the cell for its own purposes and kill it (The world book encyclopedia, 2005, p. 335). In Egypt, the glorious land of ancient Pharaohs; the people don't call themselves Egyptians any more. All of them had become Arabs. Naipaul (1998, p. 1) wrote,</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Islam is not simply a matter of conscience or private belief. It makes imperial demands. A convert's worldview alters. His holy places are in Arab lands. His sacred language is Arabic. His idea of history alters. He rejects his own: he becomes, whether he likes it or not, a part of the Arab story. The convert has to turn away from everything that is his. The disturbance for societies is immense, and even after a thousand years can remain unsolved. The turning away has to be done again and again. People develop fantasies about who and what they are</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>In sum; the Allah virus grooms the Muslim minds in such a way that they become lifelong slaves of Arabs. They can't apply minimum logic and reason to discover the true nature of Islam. Their definitions of 'good' and 'bad', 'right' and 'wrong', and 'logical' and 'illogical' are reversed. A Muslim can spend his entire life studying Qur'an, Ahadith and Muhammad's biography but he will never detect a single error in the Qur'an though he will easily find similar type of error in other scriptures. He will never notice that Muhammad was a criminal, a liar, a pedophile, a shameless womanizer, a mass murderer and a ruthless tyrant, though minor character flaws of some Catholic Priests and their sex-scandals will never go unnoticed. Even if the contradictions of Qur'an or Muhammad's flawed character is pointed out, his sick mind will try to camouflage them. All the contradictions and errors will appear as clear proofs of its divinity. They will 'sincerely' deceive themselves into believing that non-Muslims either know that Islam is truth and reject is out of pure unreasonableness or else are simply ignorant of it. As Ray (2009, p. 25) commented,</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Once infected, the individual cannot detect major contradiction in his beliefs and behavior. Belief systems become self-evident to him and no amount of logical discourse will move him from his belief</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>When the parasitic Allah virus takes over some functions of the Muslim mind, it modifies them like aliens snatch the bodies of the victims by controlling their minds. This is the time the Muslims fail the reality test. From the very deep bottom of their heart, they know that hatred towards a fellow human being is wrong but still they have to 'sincerely' hate the nonbelievers because Allah wants them to hate. Today Jews and Christians are the most advanced people in the world in every field and Muslims are at the bottom, but they have to 'sincerely' believe that monkeys and pigs are descendent of Jews and Christians because Allah wants them to believe. The Pakistani, Afghan, Bangladeshi and Indian Muslims immensely hate their Hindu counterpart. They understand very well that their forefathers were forced to accept Islam under sword and through deception. Every Asian Muslim is a blood relative in the direct line of descent of Hindu parents. But they have to 'sincerely' hate the Hindus, because it pleases Allah. This type of self-contradiction is not there in any other religion.</p>
<p>The parasitic viruses use specific methods for spreading the virus. In biology, the organism that spreads disease is called a vector. As example mosquito is a vector for malaria. Allah virus is the cause of the Islam disease and the vectors are Imams, Mullahs, Moulavis, Ulemas and preachers (e.g. Zakir Naik). The clerics program the common Muslims, even reengineer them so that they become effective careers of Allah virus. The Arabs and other Islamic nations spend in billions to keep this parasitic Allah virus survive through Jihadi terrorism, the holy war in the name of Allah. To ensure its own survival, Allah instructed, </p>
<p>&quot;<em>Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew</em>.&quot; (Q: 9. 41)</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.</em>&quot; (Q: 9. 20)</p>
<p>&quot;<em>O ye who believe! Shall I show you a commerce that will save you from a painful doom? Ye should believe in Allah and His messenger, and should strive for the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is better for you, if ye did but know</em>.&quot; (Q: 61.10,11).</p>
<p>&quot;<em>The (true) believers are only those who . . . strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah</em>.&quot; (Q: 49.15)</p>
<p><em>&quot;… Pay the zakat. Those saved from covetousness prosper. If you loan to Allah a beautiful loan, He will double it. He will grant Forgiveness: for Allah is most ready to appreci</em>ate&quot; (Q: 64.16).</p>
<p>Some vectors can actually be more efficient when dead. Just as the rabies virus takes over the brain of the raccoon and reprograms it to bite other animals - even at the cost of its own life - the Allah virus directs few programmed Muslims to go on suicide mission to propagate the cause of Allah. No doubt, a suicide is the ultimate act which ends the person, but when a bomber kills himself in the name of Allah, Allah's religion gets a powerful tool for propagation. Sometimes the vectors fail. Today we can see that many hardcore Islamic terrorists and radical Imams have left Islam.</p>
<p>Islam is a painful mental disease. When the Allah virus infects a person, most of the mental functions, as example; logic, reason, study, learning and critical thinking, creative imagination etc are disabled. Therefore in spite of having fully functioning brain, Muslims cannot prosper. The Allah virus originated from Mecca and it keeps the infected persons focused on Mecca through rituals and actions that reinforce their faith on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Biological viruses mutate. When Allah virus mutates, Islam divides into different sects - Sunni, Shia, Sufi etc. In biology, occasionally the mutations are so powerful that they smash even the strongest defenses of the virus. This mutation goes out of control. They are the ex-Muslims and freethinkers of Islam. They have completely eliminated their Allah virus infection.</p>
<p>When the Jihadi Muslims are painting the world with blood almost everyday, these ex-Muslims are my biggest hope. According to me, the ex-Muslims are those people whose Islam disease is cured. They have fully re-activated their brain, which was previously disabled by the deadly Allah virus. As a result they can draw their own conclusions about Islam without any priestly interpretation. As Ray (2009, p. 32) concluded,</p>
<p>&quot;<em>When people were able to read for themselves, inevitably some of them concluded that the whole enterprise was a house of cards. Most kept their mouths shut to avoid losing their heads, but others made the leap to open to openly criticize…</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Today there are many powerful threats to Allah virus. The ex-Muslim and freethinking websites have awakened many Muslims to take a hard look at their cherished faith. The recent developments in communications technology, particularly satellite television and the Internet in even the remotest harems of Islamic nations, is profoundly altering the mental climate in the Muslim world. Another threat of Allah virus is the continual march of science. Yet another threat is the Psychology. Many psychologists can clearly see what Islam does to Muslims, how it destroys healthy relationships and families, forces people into self-defeating beliefs and generates unjust hate. Religion is a major contributor to mental illness. But for Islam, it by itself is a mental illness. Humanity's worst scourge, the Allah virus must be completely eliminated from the earth like the smallpox virus which was eradicated in the 1970s from human populations. Otherwise the Allah virus, if survives, will happily take us back to Stone Age.</p>
