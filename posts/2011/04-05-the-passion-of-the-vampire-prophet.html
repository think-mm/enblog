        <p>Ever since the birth of motion pictures, movies with spiritual and religious contents had been popular subjects for the movie-makers. Such films appeal to viewers not only because they are inspiring but because they also mirror the audience's own spiritual search. We can call it &quot;ritualoid entertainment&quot;  (Grace, 2009, p. 13). Whereas most of these portrayals were as hagiopic film (a hagiography represents the life, or part of the life, of a recognized religious hero or divine figure), some movies were made in a huge historical framework where the leading characters are supposed to be divinely inspired and some were based on popular folklore. As per statistics (cited Walsh, 2003, p.16; Humphries-Brooks, 2006, p. 104), in Christianity the most popular hero is Jesus Christ and the most Jesus films present Jesus' crucifixion as a unique historical event, as example; <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>.</p>
<p>In Hindu-majority India, when the early talkie filmmakers began searching for stories for their films, Hindu religious dramas were a first and obvious choice. Two major sources tapped were the Ramayana and the Mahabharata (Gokulsing &amp; Dissanayake, 2004, p. 43). These two great Indian epics offer models in '<em>Dharma</em>' (righteousness) and continue to enjoy even today widespread popularity not only within the Hindu sphere of influence but internationally and they are recycled as theatrical dramas, in comic-book form and as television serials in many nations. Similarly, the life of Siddhartha Gautama, (known as Buddha, the founder of Buddhist faith) has been the subject of several films produced in India, Japan, Thailand, South Korea and France.</p>
<p>All these religious movies are remembered for their beauty, honesty, virtuousness, high morality and upright thoughts. The audience for religious movies far exceeds the number of other successful movie-viewers, because churches, religious schools, priests and missionaries regularly show these movies to others to glorify their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is no such effort on the part of the Muslims. The contrast is really striking. Muslims will never allow a hagiopic film representing the actual life, or part of the life, of the Prophet Muhammad that does not hide the truth or cover up the truth with dishonest tricks to fool the audience. A movie '<em>The Message</em>' was screened in 1976 and an animation film '<em>Muhammad: The Last Prophet</em>' released in 2004 focused on the early development of Islam camouflaging the war, bloodbath, deception, rape and slavery committed at the will of Muhammad and his Allah.</p>
<p>Often a question arises in our mind, why the Muslim clerics are reluctant to make a movie on Prophet Muhammad to promote Islam? Saudi Arabia spends in billions to promote Islam, but why not a single movie is produced so far to glorify Islam by representing the 'beauty, honesty, virtuousness, high morality and upright thoughts' of Prophet Muhammad, like the Christians and Hindus do for their mythological and historical heroes?</p>
<p>The answer is simple. Islam is a barbaric religion which is completely devoid of spirituality.  Islam is the paranoid delusion of an ordinary early-medieval unlettered Arab businessman. Putting such vain self-delusion on a par with the profound insights of a Shankaracharya, a Christ, a Buddha, a Confucius, a Mahavira Jain, a Gandhi, a Laozi or a Socrates, is plainly absurd. There is only deception, hate, murder, bloodshed, rape, delusion, terrorism, crime, suicide-bombing, honor-killing etc…etc. Name any antisocial activity and it's already there in Islam. If anyone wants to search for beauty, truthfulness, purity, high morality and upright thoughts in Prophet Muhammad, then surely he is living in a fool's paradise.</p>
<p>In spite of this, if a film is produced on Muhammad's honest biography, it will be a horror movie – a vampire movie that is set in background of extreme lawlessness of seventh century Arabia and Prophet Muhammad being the vampire itself. Though Muhammad is known as the &quot;Apostle of Peace&quot; by Muslims, he was in fact a terrorist, criminal and murderer whose entire religious life was based on victimizing innocents and indulging in mindless violence, carnage and massacre. He destroyed peace wherever he went, and in its place brought terror, bloodshed and death. Such a disgusting character can be compared to the vampires only. He was the evil incarnate.</p>
<p>The fictional vampires are like ghost-like entities. They are cursed creatures and considered to be damned with their fate (Etheredge, 2005, p. iv). Muhammad was a cursed Prophet. Muslims are also cursed for fully submitting to and trusting in Muhammad. Muhammad was a slave to his own delusionary fantasies as if he was possessed by an evil spirit. It was his destiny. He was at the mercy of his inner demon, Allah, the sadistic superego of a Malignant Narcissist (Das, 2010, pp. 168-73). Bukhari recorded,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Allah's Apostle said, &quot;<em>I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.</em>&quot; (Bukhari: 1.8.387)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;<em>Allah's Apostle never took revenge (over anybody) for his own sake but (he did) only when Allah's Legal Bindings were outraged in which case he would take revenge for Allah's Sake</em>.&quot; (Bukhari: 4.56.760)</p>
<p>Vampires are believed to be &quot;soulless&quot; with no conscience, a ruthless killer instinct, and a never ending thirst for human blood (Zell-Ravenheart, 2004, p. 298). Torturing innocent victims is a vampire's favorite activity. They are doomed to roam the earth and snatch souls from innocent victims. In real life we describe those who lack any kind of empathy, sympathy, mercy, and consideration etc for others as &quot;soulless&quot;. Muhammad was deprived of all human qualities. He lacked sensitivity or the capacity for deep feeling. He was heartless and cruel like soulless vampires. If the goal in life is the spiritual enlightenment to unite the conscious mind with the soul, then undoubtedly Muhammad was a great loser. Few quotes from the authentic Islamic sources,</p>
<p><em>&quot;The Prophet said, <strong>Allah made me victorious with terror&quot; </strong></em>(Bukhari: 1.7.331). </p>
<p>&quot;<em>I will bring you slaughter.</em>'&quot; (Ishaq: 130; Tabari: VI.101) </p>
<p><em>&quot;It is not for any Prophet to have captives until he hath made slaughter in the land</em>_&quot;_<em> </em>(Q: 8.67)</p>
<p><em>&quot;Allah said, '<strong>A Prophet must slaughter before collecting captives</strong>. <strong>Muhammad, you craved the desires of this world, its goods and the ransom captives would bring. But Allah desires killing them to manifest the religion'&quot;</strong></em> (Ishaq: 327)</p>
<p>_&quot;Killing disbelievers is a small matter to us&quot; _(Tabari: IX.69).</p>
<p>_&quot;Killing them (infidels) was sweeter than drink&quot; _(Ishaq: 576)</p>
<p><em>&quot;<strong>Warfare is ordained for you…</strong>&quot;</em><em> </em>(Q: 2.216).</p>
<p>_&quot;… if you kill, kill well: and if you slaughter, slaughter well&quot; _(Al-Nawawi, Hadith no. 17).</p>
<p>The vampire uses people as tools and sources of supply to continue his existence. This is his constant, futile search for deliverance. Throughout his prophetic life Muhammad searched for narcissistic supplies while pretending a Prophet (Das, 2010, pp. 81-95). He used others for his selfish needs and to exist as a Prophet. Allah's erotic paradise is the largest and the sweetest carrot that was ever dangled before the Muslims to motivate them to fight in the cause of Allah. When Muslims fight, kill or get killed, it was Muhammad who benefited from their sacrifice. Bukhari wrote,</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Allah's Apostle said, '<strong>Whoever obeys me will enter paradise, and whoever disobeys me will not enter it</strong></em>'&quot; (Bukhari: 9.92.384)</p>
<p>The lure of paradise turned early Muslims into moth eager to cremate themselves in the flame of the Allah's cause, <em>i.e.</em>, holy Jihad. Muhammad's overview was simple: &quot;Serve me now, bring booty and women for me and if necessary die for my cause without expecting anything in return in this worldly life and I assure you that Allah will reward you later—much later after your death.&quot;</p>
<p> &quot;<em>And what though ye be slain in Allah's way or die therein? Surely pardon from Allah and mercy are better than all that they amass</em>.&quot;  (Q: 3.157)</p>
<p><em>&quot;The Believers fight in Allah's cause, they slay and are slain, kill and are killed&quot;</em> (Q: 9.112).</p>
<p>The vampire did not choose his fate willingly. Muhammad was a Malignant Narcissist and his narcissism developed by faulty parenting. He had not received enough love and attention from his parents when he needed those most. Because of this, the emerging &quot;self&quot; of Muhammad was devastated, which forced him to split his normal healthy personality into a real and a false self (Das, 2010, p.78). Chroniclers have recorded Muhammad's disrupted childhood which is also confirmed in the Qur'an, </p>
<p><em>&quot;Did He not find thee an orphan and protect (thee)? Did He not find thee wandering and direct (thee)? Did He not find thee destitute and enrich (thee)?&quot;</em> (Q: 93.6-8).</p>
<p>The vampire cannot see his own image in a mirror because he is a spirit and not a physical being (Pucket <em>et.al</em>, 1981, p. 1123). Spirits don't cast a reflection. But when the spirit finds a suitable body and takes a physical form and sees his reflection he becomes very pale with dark eyes / lips. For a Malignant Narcissist, self-images, like photographs, portraits, emotional music identified with a certain period in his life are 'emotional handles' which scares him. He is scared that at any unguarded moment his true self may get accidentally discovered. This is one of the reasons, Muhammad prohibited drawing his portrait. He was so paranoid that he even feared to look at his own picture.</p>
<p>There are few stories about vampires which detail vampirism as being a curse which was acquired from ancient evils and must be passed on to innocent victims in more 'satanic' methods. When Muhammad was a peaceful preacher at Mecca, people mocked him by seeing the irrationality of his faith and looked at him with much suspicion. His peaceful religious endeavor was an utter failure.</p>
<p><em>&quot;</em><em>I heard the Apostle say, 'I have never invited anyone to accept Islam who hasn't shown signs of reluctance, suspicion and hesitation</em><em>.<strong>'</strong></em><strong>&quot;</strong> (Ishaq: 116).</p>
<p><em>&quot;They take you not except for mockery&quot; </em>(Q: 21.36).</p>
<p><em>&quot;And when they see you, they treat you only as a mockery&quot; </em>(Q: 25. 41).</p>
<p>Allah is such an ungodly God that Muhammad needed the two satanic methods – use of sword and deception to sell this failed God. Even today, Muslims pass on this satanic cult by these two satanic methods. Bukhari confirms that Muhammad was a master of deception. His entire prophetic life was full of lies and deception. Telling lies to advance the cause of Islam is divinely allowed in Islam. This is called 'Taqiyya' (holy deception). </p>
<p><em>&quot;Allah willing, if ever I take an oath to do something, and later on I find that it is more beneficial </em><em>to do something different, I will do the thing which is better, and give expiation for my oath&quot;. </em>(Bukhari: 4.53.361).</p>
<p> <em>&quot;I am the best of plotters. I deceived them with My guile so that I delivered you from them.&quot; </em>(Ishaq: 323)</p>
<p>When deception did not work, Muhammad used the sword.</p>
<p><em>&quot;When the sacred months are over, slay the idolaters wherever you find them. Take them and confine them, then lie in ambush everywhere for them. If they repent and establish the prayer and pay the obligatory charity, let them go their way.&quot;</em> (Q: 9.5). </p>
<p>Its not that vampires are always searching for a victim to drink blood. They wait for suitable moments to attack. It is difficult to recognize a vampire at first glance. They look just like and pass for any other normal human being from time to time (Bart, 2002, p. 217.). Others cannot really recognize them unless they reveal themselves to them. When Muhammad's divine mission was a complete failure at Mecca, luck favored him and he gained the trust of the inhabitants of the oasis settlement of Medina. They promised Muhammad to propagate his message at Medina. But what Muhammad gave them in return? He raised a band of hooligans and started attacking the rich Meccan caravans. Abu Afak, a 120 year old man recognized Muhammad as an imposter. Muhammad got him assassinated. A Jewish mother by the name Asma bint Marwan protested strongly. Muhammad got her assassinated too.</p>
<p>In March 628, Muhammad signed an agreement with the Meccans which demanded a cessation of hostility from both sides for a ten year period. In Islamic history, this is known as 'the treaty of Hudaybiya'. But it took very little time for Muhammad to breach this treaty. Within just two years time of signing the treaty of Hudaybiya, Muhammad's army became strong enough to defeat the Quraysh. In January 630, he marched towards Mecca with an army of ten thousand fighting men.</p>
<p><em> &quot;Allah's Apostle said, 'War is deceit.'&quot;</em> (Bukhari: 4.52.268)</p>
<p>Simply speaking, the Medinese trusted Muhammad but Muhammad proved to be disloyal. The Quraysh trusted Muhammad but Muhammad proved to be treacherous. These are just two examples of Muhammad's dishonesty. Vampires in the guise of Prophets can be everywhere. </p>
<p>According to the folklore, a human becomes vampire when a vampire bites him and drinks his blood. Even then the victim is not a true vampire until he makes his first kill of an innocent and tastes his blood (Maberry, 2008, p. 229). It means a vampire can only be created by another vampire and it happens when they come in close proximity. Muhammad treated his followers as an extension of his own personality. It is through those early Muslims, Muhammad, the Malignant Narcissist wanted to settle &quot;open accounts&quot; with the enemy-world. According to Vaknin (1999, p. 11), people who are in daily contact with a Narcissist are &quot;infected&quot; and &quot;changed forever&quot;. Narcissism is such a contagious disease that it spoils the lives of the victims even when their Narcissist leader is no more. Like the transformation into a vampire, slowly, the early companions of Muhammad absorbed Muhammad's way of destructive thinking and became as deadly as their leader just like a dark Shakespearian tragedy unfolding in front of us. They were programmed to materialize the unfulfilled narcissistic dreams and fantasies of their Narcissist leader. In doing so, they all became Narcissist themselves. This is why the terror survived Muhammad's death because he left a legacy that manufactured more Muhammads as example; Bakr, Ali, Umar, Uthman, Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, Mullah Omar. The greatness of the leader depends upon the quality of the followers. A poisonous tree produces poisonous fruits. A mass-murderer cannot teach 'nonviolence' like Gandhi.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a movie is made on Muhammad's biography, then the bloody stories of Muhammad's trail of violence, hatred, deception, delusion, narcissism, sexual exploitation and bloodshed, would be the 'beauty, honesty, virtuousness and high morality' of that movie. Such a torture-porn-horror movie would be truly scary movie which will leave the audience screaming and hiding behind the seats during the scariest scenes.</p>
<p>Gibson, the director of the movie &quot;<em>The Passion of the Christ</em>&quot;, said (Strauss &amp; Miller, 2011; Deacy, 2005, p. 120), &quot;<em>This is a movie about love, hope, faith, and forgiveness. He [Jesus] died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more love, faith, hope, and forgiveness.</em>&quot; </p>
<p>'<em>Love, faith, hope, and forgiveness</em>' are the divine words. We do not find them in vampire movies. At the end of the movie, as Jesus hangs from the cross, he prays forgiveness for those who did this to him and redeems a criminal crucified next to him. In a similar movie, let's say '<em>The Passion of the Muhammad</em>', would end with the dying wishes of the revengeful Muhammad, &quot;<em>Oh Lord, destroy the Jews and Christians. Let the Lord's anger be kindled against them. </em><em>Let there remain throughout Arabia no other religion except Islam</em>.&quot; </p>
<p><em>'The Passion of the Vampire-Prophet'</em>, the holy Islamic panic-special vampire movie, will end with the destruction of the vampire. According to the folklore, the destruction of the vampire comes about when he is exposed to sunlight (Zell-Ravenheart, 2004, p. 298). At the end every vampire and every fake Prophet is a loser. The myth of Muhammad's prophethood, his cult Islam, his book Qur'an and his God Allah would be eradicated when his deception would be exposed. That day is not far away.</p>
