<pre><code>                                                 Part one 
</code></pre>
<p>About ten years ago, one day, I was waiting for my train at the Asansol railway station. Near me, was sitting a man, a book in his hand- a big volume novel. After introducing and a little chatting with him, I learned the gentleman would have to wait for his train the whole day. But my train was due to arrive after three hours. Both of us were Bengali. So, a moment later, I asked him, &quot;May I see your book, please?&quot;
'Of course, please-'
Normal and desired response. Right away, I immersed myself in the book and forgot the scorching summer noon and excessive heat emanating from the tin roof of the railway station.
What a fascinating novel! I said in my mind.
The owner of the book squinted at me and knitted his brow. Then he took a timetable and focus on it while I kept devouring the book.<br />
What an excellent book!
In fact, it was the best novel I had ever read and it held me enthralled.
Two hours passed.
Flipping the timetable for some time, at last, the gentleman glanced at me and said, &quot;Your train would arrive soon, so now...&quot;
And then he cleared his throat.
I was spellbound then. I peeped at the wrist-watch and saw that I still had one hour in my hand. But more than half of the book was still left. Hence, I didn't waste time by chatting and continued pouring over the book.<br />
What a splendid book!
The remaining hour flew away. Bell chimed to announce the arriving of my train. A good part of the book was still left. But I went mad to finish it and told him, &quot;I will go by the next train- I must finish it.&quot; At the words, the owner gave a polite cough and fell silent.
The train arrived and left the station while I kept myself buried in the book.
But I couldn't finish reading the book, as at the back, many pages were ripped out.
I told the owner, &quot;Oh, many pages are torn out! Why didn't you mention it before? Shit&quot;
At my words, the gentleman gave me a blank stare. Also, I noticed his veins popped out.</p>
<pre><code>                                                             Part two 
</code></pre>
<p>Ten years after the incident, I reached another copy of the book in my niece's husband's house. To escort her, I went there and was supposed to come back the same day. But longing to read the book obliged me to lodge. In leisure time, I took the book and dipped into it. I resolved to read the entire book from the beginning, not the last part only.
After some pages, I had a doubt if it was the same book. So, to become certain, I flip through it and found it was the very book, whereupon I wade through some more pages. But it failed to entice me. Yet, I went on. After a while, I perceived I couldn't take it anymore. I wondered if it was the same book that had beguiled me at one hot summer noon at Asansole railway station.<br />
How could one write this rubbish! Finishing it was impossible.
I didn't even realize when I had lost my avid interest in reading books.
Now I couldn't finish the book, either.</p>
