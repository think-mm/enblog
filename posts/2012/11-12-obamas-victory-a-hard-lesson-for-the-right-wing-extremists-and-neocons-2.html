<p>This last US election was very personal to my wife - Bonna, and me. We knew  President Obama's first term was patchy. He had faced the challenge of handling  one of the worst recessions since the Great Depression: the unemployment rate  was rising tremendously, the housing market collapsed, gas prices were  skyrocketing, and so on. Despite all this, we did not desire to replace Obama  with Mitt Romney, a fate that would have undoubtedly rewound the nation back to  Bush's failed policy – the ultimate root of all mess. Shouldn't the final blame  be administered to George Bush, the &quot;Cowboy Diplomat&quot;, who &quot;drove our new car  into this ditch&quot; in broad daylight? Well, I am not making this up - let the data  decide. When George W. Bush took office from Clinton, the US reserve had 5.6  trillion dollar surplus; by the time Bush left office, however, we suddenly  found ourselves in an ocean of 11-plus-trillion dollar debt.  Obama put forth  the effort to steer America out of this ditch; or in more specific terms, he at  least stopped the problem from escalating. Despite his shortcomings, President  Obama has managed to drag America's economy back from the brink of disaster,  thus avoiding a double dip recession. This alone is a fair enough achievement  for us to choose him as the captain of our ship. But Obama's changes tackled not  only economic issues, but on critical social issues as well: women's health, a  woman's choice to abort, gay rights, minority rights, marriage equality,  immigration policy, and health care, just to name a few. These issues were so  vital that we even decided to make a personal contribution to Obama's campaign.  But I'm not mentioning this for the purpose of bragging. Our contribution,  regardless of how large or small it may have been, was a really serious decision  from our part. We had never contributed to any political campaign before --not  in Bangladesh, the country in the world where I was born more than forty years  ago, and not in the US where I finally moved and settled with my family. This  time, we decided to take an action during the election campaign, not because we  entirely agreed with the media calling it 'most important election of our  lifetime', but because we at least realized some of its gravity. I am glad that  our small contribution was paid off as the results were in accord with our  aspirations for this nation.</p>
<p>Yes, Barack Obama made history again. Four years ago, he became the first  African American elected president, promoting a wave of hope and promises of  change.  Tuesday night he was victorious in crucial states (such as Iowa,  Wisconsin, and Ohio), allowing him to be the 17<sup>th</sup> President to win a  second term. Moreover, he is probably the first president since Franklin  Roosevelt to win a two- term with unemployment rates so high (around 8%) and the  nation looking so uneasy about the its future.  The president stormed to victory  in swing states, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin, assuring his re-election even  as voters in Florida, Virginia, and Colorado rendered a closer verdict.</p>
<p>Many of the republican &quot;pundits&quot; like Dick Morris, Ann Coulter, Newt Gingrich,  Karl Rove et al had predicted a Romney landslide. In the end, however, the  result wasn't even close. Barack Obama won handily with 303 electoral votes, way  more than the 270 electoral votes needed for his second term. Of the nine  battleground states that were up for grabs, Obama won 7 of them, losing only  North Carolina (Florida was still limbo sate). In effect, it was President Obama  who had a landslide victory instead of Romney, the exact opposite of what his  Republican opposition had predicted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dick_morris_landslide.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1474" src="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dick_morris_landslide.jpg" alt="" width="515" height="315" /></a><strong>Pic:</strong> Fox  News political analyst Dick Morris, repeatedly predicted a "landslide" victory  for Mitt Romney.</p>
Based on my observation of current events, the Republican Party has made a name  for itself as a greedy, self-centered, and old-fashioned "grandma" party.   Tuesday's verdict showed that the majority of the nation does not desire to  embrace this description. Governor Romney and his team mate Paul Ryan lost even  in their own states, Massachusetts and Wisconsin respectively.  The majority of  young folks chose Obama for his stable vision, rather than putting Romney, and  subsequent war-mongering Republicans in power. More encouraging news on election  night was how Richard Murdock and Todd Akin, the leaders of the Republican  party's newly dubbed "<a href="https://jezebel.com/5958480/team-rape-lost-big-last-night">Team  Rape</a>",  all lost. So much for preaching, 'some girls rape easy', 'legitimate  rape' and 'God-intended rape' by the Republican prophets of rape!  Perhaps Todd  Akin's idea that women can 'shut that whole thing down' (in reference to a  woman's supposed ability to terminate a pregnancy at will) was right after all;  when women's bodies are threatened by men, they can really shut that all down –  and its by voting! Obama's support from women is seen in how 55 percent of women  voted for him, as well as in the fact that Obama had higher likability factor  among single women than Romney did. Single and unmarried women voted  overwhelmingly in favor of Obama in this election and the statistics infuriated  conservatives (see <a href="https://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/09/why_did_romney_lose_fox_news_blames_single_women.html"> here</a>). It seems as if Beyoncé was indeed correct - It was 'all the single  ladies' who put their hands up, and brought millions to vote for Barack "<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/president-obama-mash-up-im-sexy-and-i-know-it-16027669">I  am Sexy, and I know it</a>" Obama. The "Mating Mind" of evolutionary psychology  triumphs after all, even in the presidential election!
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Todd_Akin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1475" src="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Todd_Akin.jpg" alt="" width="380" height="281" /></a><strong>Pic :</strong> Todd Akin, former Republican Missouri Senate candidate, said that victims of  "legitimate rape" don't get pregnant because "the female body has ways to try to  shut that whole thing down." In other words, he is saying that if a woman does  get pregnant, she must not have been "legitimately raped".</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ap_richard_mourdock_god_intended_rape.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1476" src="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ap_richard_mourdock_god_intended_rape.jpg" alt="" width="517" height="291" /></a><strong>Pic:</strong> Former Indiana Treasurer Richard Mourdock said, "even when life begins in that  horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."</p>
The media has always been a huge factor in most US elections; suffice to say,  truth also exists outside the confines of Fox News! As television networks began  declaring that President Barack Obama had won re-election, the most captivating  televised drama Tuesday evening played out on Fox News, where Republican  strategist <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/11/09/opinion/kurtz-karl-rove/index.html"> Karl Rove refused to believe the race between Obama and Mitt Romney was over</a>.   Poor Rove! Self-proclaimed media pundit <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/karl-rove-read-nate-silver/2012/11/08/69164910-29ce-11e2-bab2-eda299503684_blog.html"> Karl should have learned from Nate Silver</a>, a former baseball statistician  who now authors a blog for the New York Times called <em>FiveThirtyEight</em>, correctly predicted the winner of each of the 50 states way before the election  was over. Comedian Jon Stewart of "The Daily Show" nailed it on his show this  week that Nate's method worked because rather than being based on right wing  bias, it was based off of simple science and, most importantly,  "arithmetic"!
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Karl_rove.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1477" src="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Karl_rove.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="373" /></a><strong>Pic:</strong> Republican strategist Karl Rove refused to believe the race between Obama and  Mitt Romney was over on election night.</p>
However, it's not only the angry, ultra-conservative pundits who created the  mess; the two candidates, particularly Romney, also had something major to  contribute. Let's consider the famous auto bailout incident. Romney could not  overcome the 'Let Detroit Go Bankrupt' column that he had opinioned four years  prior for <em>The New York Times</em>. He also opposed aid for General Motors  Corp. and Chrysler LLC, saying that they should file for bankruptcy before  getting government aid.  As if not enough, Romney also failed to have a  consistent message for the auto industry, evidenced by a notorious comment in  one of his campaign ads just before the election -
<blockquote>"I saw a story today that one of the great manufacturers in this state, Jeep —  now owned by the Italians — is thinking of moving all production to China,"  Romney said at a rally in Defiance, Ohio, home to a General Motors powertrain  plant. "I will fight for every good job."</blockquote>
The story came out to be  entirely false — Chrysler was actually considering  adding Jeep production in China for Chinese buyers — and it had been pointed by  Chrysler chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, before Romney got time to manage  it. In addition, GM has also criticized the Republican's tactics, claiming the  advertisements encapsulated "cynical politics." The Ohio exit polls showed that  59 percent favored the auto bailout and 36 percent opposed it. Of those in  favor, 75 percent voted for Obama. Also, despite the repeated right-wing attack  on Obama's stimulus program, federal stimulus had created an estimated 3 million  jobs. Fox-watching right wingers never understood the benefits that poor and  middleclass people would derive from Obama's healthcare.
<p>As long as the Republican Party continues to let anti-science, religious  fundamentalists, such as Rush Limbaugh, Shawn Hannity, Karl Rove, and Dick  Morris, the so-called &quot;team of rape&quot; dictates its social agenda, I see no hope  for the party in future. At the moment, this party is very vocal against gay  rights and abortion rights, and it is mainly dominated by extreme, right wing  tea-party and religious nuts.  Female voters and socially progressive people are  sick of attacks on immigrants, gays,  women,  and their respective rights.  The  Republican Party cannot fathom that the younger generation would not support  such ultra-conservativeness.  Gay rights and marriage, for example, were once  considered taboo topics and were so controversial that right-wingers used the  issue to demonize the liberals.  But gone are those days! Polls show the younger  generation to be far more liberal about gay marriage than those over the age of  fifty, and they are more likely to personally know and associate themselves with  gay couples and friends.  My daughter and her school friends are even evidence  of this, seeing as they view the issue quite differently from the previous  generation.</p>
<p>This past May, President Obama became the first sitting president to support  marriage equality, and he has continued to voice his support for the LGBT  community. He admits that his two daughters, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57431342/president-obama-says-sasha-and-malia-influenced-his-stance-on-same-sex-marriage/"> Sasha and Malia, influenced his stance on same-sex marriage</a>.  This time,  voters even elected the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate, Tammy  Baldwin. Politicians will lose ground if they continuously ignore the minds of  young people and maintain the conservative status quo.  On the top of it, the  Republicans are also going to face a huge crisis in the near future: the  &quot;melting pot&quot; status of the United States. This US is growing less and less  white, whereas its coalition has become more white in recent years, forming  policies that are tougher on immigrants.  What conclusions can we make when we  see that President Obama won the Hispanic vote by 44 percentage points, 8  percentage points more than in 2008? Even Matthew Dowd, a former campaign  adviser to President George W. Bush, referred to the Republican Party as &quot;a 'Mad  Men' party in a 'Modern Family' America and &quot;it just doesn't fit any more''  on  ABC's Good Morning America.</p>
<p><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tammy_baldwin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1478" src="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tammy_baldwin.jpg" alt="" width="545" height="385" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Pic</strong>: In this election voters elected the first openly lesbian member of the U.S.  Senate, Tammy Baldwin.</p>
And then there's Donald Trump. Sincerely Republicans, who needs an enemy when  Donald trump is on your side? Despite the robustness of Trump's head and  hairstyle, he seems to be missing a vital part of his forebrain. But then, how  can the fun of a presidential election, 'The Greatest Show on Earth', be  complete without the contribution of America's number one clown? This must be  the reason Trump, who lacks the intellectual capacity of an average ant,  continues to receive so much press coverage.
<p>On election night, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-twitter-obama-win-re-election-2012-11">Trump began tweeting</a> in the wake of President Barack Obama's  projected victory  -</p>
<blockquote>"The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy,"</blockquote>
fumed the celebrity  mogul. He then tweeted,
<blockquote>"We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty.  Our nation is totally divided!"</blockquote>
After news outlets projected that Obama had won, Trump tweeted,
<blockquote>"Well, back to  the drawing board!"</blockquote>
He then proceeded to encourage a
<blockquote>"revolution in this  country."</blockquote>
Huh? Revolution? March on Washington? Trump sounds more like a Castro-loving,  revolution-seeking socialist (I thought it was Obama?) than the real estate,  capitalist mogul that he is.  But, who knows,  I may be wrong; perhaps, capitalism has  other meaning nowadays.
<p>Interestingly, Donald Trump deleted those tweets next day – the tweets calling  for 'revolution' and incorrectly saying that Obama had lost the popular vote.</p>
<p>Donald has had a long history of talking such nonsense to put himself in the  center of media spotlight. He has been a leading proponent of the 'birther'  theory that Obama does not have the right to be president because he was born in  Kenya, although the state of Hawaii has offered documents to prove that Obama  was indeed born in the States.  It has been more than a year after President  Barack Obama released a copy of his long-form birth certificate, and looks like  Donald Trump is still not convinced. Recently, Trump challenged in a home-made  video that if President Obama released his college records and his passport  application, the businessman would give a $5 million check to a charity of  Obama's choosing.</p>
<p><a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/donald_trump_bill_maher.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1487" src="https://enblog.muktomona.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/donald_trump_bill_maher.png" alt="" width="499" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>I found last week comedian and political satirist Bill Maher's following comment  his show, <em>Real Time With Bill Maher </em>on HBO, very amusing:</p>
<blockquote>"New Rule: Donald Trump must immediately submit to a DNA test to determine — to  determine whether he is, in fact, the love child of a human woman and an  orangutan from the Brooklyn Zoo. Look, Donald, I'm not saying that your mother  was repeatedly fucking an orangutan back in the 1940s. I don't know if that's  true, I hope it's not true. But given your face, your physique, your  intelligence level, and of course your hair, the American people deserve some  real proof that your mother did not spend most nights in 1945 covering her body  in banana oil, sneaking into the monkey cage, and compulsively humping an  orange-haired ape."</blockquote>
Well "Birther clowns" are not only on the conservative side, but exist on the  progressive side as well. Remember Ali Sina -- the founder of Faith Freedom  International, who claims that thousands of Muslims have left Islam after  reading his articles and books - has often been cited by Desi- neocons to  propagate their anti-Islamic zeal and their profound hatred towards Muslims,  would be an interesting case in discussion. While I often consider Sina's  debunking of Islam important, his political ideology is as extreme, if not more  so, as the Republican crazy-nuts.  Philosophically, he is incapable of  differentiating between science and the paranormal mumbo jumbos. He once came  out a supporter of new-age paranormal, psychic power and voodoo science (Some  proofs are <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com//Special_Event_/rationalist_day/rationalist_debate.htm"> here</a>), even though he loved to call himself a 'rational person'.  But let's  not dwell on such paradoxical philosophical dilemmas today; some of my rational  friends including "amazing" James Randi, Brent Meeker and Aparthib have already  exposed his unstable rational philosophy few years ago (see <a href="https://gold.mukto-mona.com//Special_Event_/rationalist_day/rationalist_debate.htm"> here</a> or <a href="https://forums.randi.org/showthread.php?t=20120"> here</a>). Let's rather focus today on his hatemongering neo-conservative  gibberish towards the US president he made.  When Obama elected for the first  time, all the progressive sites like Mukto-Mona rejoiced the victory of first  African American president (see <a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/?p=15"> here</a>, or <a href="https://enblog.muktomona.com/?p=86"> here</a>; Bengali readers can read some of our Bangla articles from <a href="https://blog.muktomona.com/?p=3"> here</a>, <a href="https://blog.muktomona.com/?p=651"> here</a>, <a href="https://blog.muktomona.com/?p=99"> here</a> or <a href="https://blog.muktomona.com/?p=90"> here</a>). There were reasons for us to be happy and proud. When looking back at  the sweep of American presidency over the last 112 years, most of the names,  policies and days can easily get lost in the mist of time. However, some moments  are simply unforgettable and profound, as Steve Jobs liked to say, they "made a  dent in the Universe". Similar to JFK rejoicing first moon landing, LBJ invoking  "we shall overcome" to pass the Voting Rights Act, and Regan demanding "Mr.  Gorbachev, tear down the wall" to end the cold war, Obama was also able to stir  the world when he addressed the nation in his victory speech of the election of  2008 –"If there is anyone out there who doubts that America is a place where  anything is possible", he uttered, 'tonight is your answer'. It was indeed a  defining moment in the history of US presidency. That a man whose ancestors  included a slave could come to be the leader of a nation founded to some extent  in slavery, is as much an achievement for the country as it is a marker for  Obama himself. Most people in the US and outside viewed Obama as decent,  intelligent, progressive and principled person, however, right after the 2008  election, Iranian ex-Muslim 'freethinker' Ali began penning a series of articles  describing Obama to be a closet-muslim, outright liar, narcissist, and fraud.   For example, in one of his articles <a href="https://www.faithfreedom.org/obama.html"> Ali wrote</a>,
<blockquote>"Pathological narcissism, is not akin to typical narcissism—someone with a  hedonistic or self-centered sense of self —but rather someone with a very weak  sense of self. Obama's narcissism is pathological.</blockquote>
Ali was so sure that the American president was a 'fraud', that <a href="https://www.faithfreedom.org/articles/op-ed/obama-and-the-birth-of-mobocracy-in-america/"> he penned an article in his self-proclaimed Freethinking site</a> saying:
<blockquote>"Obama came to power via fraud. He is not a 'natural born' U.S. citizen. The  clear proof of that is that despite 31 lawsuits filed against him demanding he  prove his eligibility for the U.S. Presidency, he has instead hired three law  firms and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to avoid discovery and evade a  judicial review".</blockquote>
As mentioned earlier, President Obama  decided to release his  'long-form birth  certificate' in response to the moronic ramblings of these "birthers". Not  surprisingly, the copy of his long-form birth certificate could not convince  'freethinker' Ali Sina, just like it could not convince 'republican  intellectual' Donald Trump, otherwise. Sina wrote an article '<a href="https://www.faithfreedom.org/features/news/the-audacity-of-fraud/">The  Audacity of Fraud</a>' where he claimed that a forged certificate was put in the  US government site to fool people.  He declared, "the forgery has been made by  someone with very little knowledge of Photoshop and layers, which makes me  believe that it is done by Obama himself". In the same article Sina mentioned  Donald Trump's name at least twice as a legitimate source, asserting that  "Donald Trump did a great work forcing this impostor to make this move that  should seal his doom" (I was so amused by this that it reminded me of the old  saying, "Birds of a feather flock together"). While even neo-cons favor Fox-News  confessed that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/04/29/expert-says-obamas-birth-certificate-legit/"> No Doubt Obama's Birth Certificate Is Legit</a>, and  numerous sites (like <a href="https://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/birthcertificate.asp"> this one</a>)  investigated the certificate  independently, or even few books  have been written by computer experts  (for e.g.  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Barack-Obamas-Birth-Certificate-Fraud/dp/0983759251">Is  Barack Obama's Birth Certificate a Fraud?: A Computer Guy Examines The Evidence  For Forgery</a> by John Woodman), and all came to the same conclusion that  Obama's certificate was indeed real, nevertheless, 'non-narcissist rational  freethinker' Ali Sina had no doubt in his mind that "the document is tampered.  The president of the united states is a criminal."
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Though Ali stayed mysteriously silent in recent election, it takes little  intellect to make the assumption that  Sina and  other Neo-Con cohorts alike  were a tad bit hurt when it was announced that 'Kenya-born, non-American,  criminal Muslim', Barack Hussein Obama, had won reelection. Let Trump and Sina  mourn for a while, and let the rest of us--who view  Obama  not as a 'Muslim', a  'Kenyan', nor a 'socialist', but as a 'two-term all-American President' (just as  Woodrow Wilson, Eisenhower, Ronald Regan,  Bill Clinton and others who served  two full terms)--celebrate his humble victory. The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/news/politics/topoftheticket/la-na-tt-obama-victory-20121106,0,2145466.story"> cartoon caption published in LA Times</a> after Obama's victory captures the  notion succinctly:</p>

<p>On election night, after a long, nail-biting,<em> Rove-created confusing hours</em>, President Obama received the &quot;concession call&quot; from Romney, who went  into Election Night expecting a landslide victory and was &quot;shellshocked&quot; when he  finally came to terms with the fact that he had lost. Obama sent an email to his  supporters and contributors, where one copy of the email came to my account:</p>
<blockquote>Avijit --
<p>I'm about to go speak to the crowd here in Chicago, but I wanted to thank you first.</p>
<p>I want you to know that this wasn't fate, and it wasn't an accident. You made this happen.</p>
<p>You organized yourselves block by block. You took ownership of this campaign five and ten dollars at a time. And when it wasn't easy, you pressed forward.</p>
<p>I will spend the rest of my presidency honoring your support, and doing what I can to finish what we started.</p>
<p>But I want you to take real pride, as I do, in how we got the chance in the first place.</p>
<p>Today is the clearest proof yet that, against the odds, ordinary Americans can overcome powerful interests.</p>
<p>There's a lot more work to do.</p>
<p>But for right now: Thank you.</p>
<p>Barack</blockquote>

<p>&quot;This wasn't fate, and it wasn't an accident. You made this happen&quot; – is still  resounding in my head, even though I know I was only one of the millions of  supporters and activists who helped make this memorable incident happen received this email.  But still, I felt special that election night.</p>
<p>Four years ago, the nation's cause for celebration was that the United States  had elected its first black president, a revolutionary step that symbolized how  much progress this country has made since the Civil Rights Movement. But 2012  was different, as voters focused on other problems, spanning from unsettled  Middle East, to the horrible state of the economy, to the deep political  divisions in Washington D.C. Suffice to say, it was a tough election. The  ultimate result, however, proves that racism, lies, right-wingers' and Neo-Cons'  continuous propaganda, and four years of endless obstruction were not enough to  stop Barack Obama from winning a second term. Other big winners in this election  included, as Jon Stewart and Bill Maher pointed out in their comedy shows -  legalization of pot, respect for same-sex marriage and, of course, the  &quot;arithmetic&quot;. Obama's win was not only a victory for him, but for the nation as  a whole:  the progressive and liberal philosophy prospered, social consciousness  rose, and the money and politics of corporate conservativeness, religious  fanaticism, and cynicism were roundly defeated. Congrats to Obama. You deserve  it for keeping our hopes high.</p>
<p>I echo the words of Bruce Springsteen, the famous American singer-songwriter of  our time - &quot;For me, President Obama is our best choice because he has a vision  of the United States as a place where we are all in this together&quot;.</p>
<p>Now let's come together to embrace the sound judgment of the people of the  United States who nominated President Obama for four more years.</p>
