    <p class="post-meta">Published on Saturday, 18 March 2017</p>
<p>In the west, the discourse on Islam has been greatly shaped by contentious debates on the role of the state. The germination of radical ideas among the European-Muslim millennials and recent terrorist attacks across Europe has bolstered the edifice of the populist right-wing ideas, and there is a rising trend in the popularity of the far-right political parties who promulgate such ideas. The current scenario in the Western world is pretty much an evocative picture of the pre-Second World War political turmoil. The shadow of a disintegrated European Union looms on the horizon. Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump rose to power hurling disparaging remarks towards Muslims while promising a Muslim ban and extreme vetting of the Muslim immigrants.  In these altercations, the culturalists and the reformists, the two different schools of thought gained prominence offering very different connotations of the Islamic pedigrees and culture in their attempt to dispense with the problem of &quot;Radical Islam.&quot;</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2017/03-18-an-occidental-islam-between-culturalist-and-reformist-expediencies">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Saturday, 25 February 2017</p>
<p>A software engineer by profession and a writer by passion Avijit Roy(1972-2015) was a leading Bangladeshi-American human rights activist, author and a pioneer in Bengali free-thought movement. In 2001, Avijit launched a virtual discussion group of freethinkers of mainly Bengali and South Asian descent. This small discussion group would eventually lead to the inception of the first secular humanist website in the Bengali language, called 'Mukto-mona.' The literal English translation of 'Mukto-Mona' is 'Free-thinker.' As an Internet congregation of freethinkers, rationalists, skeptics, atheists &amp; humanists Mukto-Mona gave a platform for the secular ethos of Bangladeshi culture to be reinvigorated.  In an interview with a daily newspaper, Avijit described his organization's aspirations by the following lines,</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2017/02-26-remembering-the-life-and-legacy-of-avijit-roy">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 22 August 2016</p>
<p>Zahir Raihan (19 August 1935 – 30 January 1972) was a Bangladeshi novelist, writer and filmmaker. He is perhaps best known for his documentary ''Stop Genocide'', made during the Bangladesh Liberation War. He was an activist of the Language Movement of 1952. The influence of the language movement was so high on him that he made his legendary film &quot;Jibon Theke Neya&quot; based on his experience. In 1971 he joined the Liberation War of Bangladesh and created documentary films on this great event. He mysteriously disappeared on January 30, 1972 trying to locate his brother, the famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser, who was captured and killed by the Pakistan army. Evidences have been found that he was killed by some armed Bihari collaborators and disguised soldiers of Pakistan Army.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/08-22-zahir-raihan-was-accused-of-defaming-sheikh-mujib">Read more...</a></p>
