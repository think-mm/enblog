    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 25 September 2016</p>
<p>I do not know – how many people, who watched the Democratic National Committee (DNC) convention in Philadelphia, noticed resounding boos… from the diehard Bernie-supporters at the moment Bernie endorsed Hillary for President. So, it was clear that Bernie supporters were disappointed with him for his public endorsement of Hillary Clinton. On the other hand, Ted Cruz was also showered with boos in the Republican convention at Cleveland, Ohio; that was for not endorsing the front runner, Mr. Trump. So, these two boos are for two different reasons. Most diehard democrats and republicans may have missed these moments, but, it was a striking moment for me.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/09-26-take-home-messages-of-the-recent-political-conventions-in-usa">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Today, on the eve of 26th February, the day Avijit was murdered last year by Islamists, the very thought that haunted me last year is haunting me again this year - why Avijt made that dreadful trip to Bangladesh, knowing full well that a death threat hangs on his neck.

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 5 March 2015</p>
<p><b>After learning about the threat stating that - he will be killed when he comes back to Bangladesh, I, immediately, called Avijit to remind him not to go back to Bangladesh ever. I also asked him to be extra careful while he is in the USA, and advised him to forward that threat-link to FBI. He assured me by saying - &quot;Don't worry, Jiten-da, I will be careful.&quot; I heard no intimidation, but carelessness, in his voice. So, I knew, he will not change anything in his life.</b></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-05-avijit-the-knight">Read more...</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Ratan Barua left this world on Tuesday, April 1, 2014 at 6 AM. This write up is for those of you who did not get to know him before. I know - I can't tell you enough or all about him, but - I will try my best to give you a glimpse of his personality in this short write up.  He was unique in so many ways. I am not sure how to describe him; he was just different from most of us; never married, never had fascination for family-life; totally selfless. Thoughts of wellbeing of others always drove him forward. Whenever someone in the New York/tri-state area needed help for any reason, the first person he/she would remember to call for help was Ratan Barua. I am not sure how his void will be filled going forward.  </b></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/04-03-ratan-barua-my-friend">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 14 October 2013</p>
<p>Religious conversion is not merely embracing a religion; it is a package deal that includes embracing a religion, embracing a different culture and tradition, ditching parents, relatives, and friends forever. All these effects come in the same package of religious conversion. So, it has much more serious consequences than just following a different religion. In other words, it alters everything in one's life that existed moments before conversion.  Such a drastic change, once taken, cannot be reversed. So, conversion is a serious business.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/10-15-religious-conversion">Read more...</a></p>

<p><b><span style="font-family: 'Bell MT','serif'">Bangladesh is severely ill today; it needs proper treatment, which makes concerned people worried. I am surely concerned about the future of the country. The future of a country depends on the success and failure of her citizens.

Today, Garments Industries are flourishing. But, political turmoil and corruption have been always a threat to this industry. <span> </span></span></b></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/06-24-unhealthy-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>
