    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 7 March 2013</p>
<p>The movement that was started by a group of Bangladeshi youth at the Shahbag intersection in Dhaka on February 5, 2013, has grown tremendously. Initially there was just one podium in Shahbag. Now the youth all over the country have erected &quot;Gonojagoran Manchas&quot; (people's awakening podiums) in almost every sub-district of the country. The youth, led by internet savvy bloggers, have been joined by millions of ordinary people. The movement has been praised by noted intellectuals. It has also been supported by the government, even when the youth did not allow leaders of the governing political party to speak from their &quot;Gonojagoran Manchas.&quot; The youth movement has now turned into a people's movement, and it has been coined as 'Spirit of 1971' by a section of the Bangladeshi intelligentsia/media.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-07-the-spirits-of-1971-and-2013">Read more...</a></p>

<p>It was Shahana's first trip abroad. Shahana was a 10th-grader at an English medium school in Dhaka, and she was part of a student exchange program that had been jointly established by her school and a partner school in New York City. Every summer, a student from her school is selected and sent to the United States to spend four weeks with the family of a student at their partner school. In return, an American student then spends four weeks in Bangladesh in the following winter.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-01-children-like-yours">Read more...</a></p>

<p>If Mr. Mollah committed the crimes he was convicted for, and if anyone deserves to die, he does. It is hence not surprising that the death penalty is on everybody's lips in Bangladesh these days. However, we do not wish to comment on the case of Mr. Mollah, as we would hardly be in a position to do so. We leave this case to others more familiar with it and more competent than us. Instead, we will offer some thoughts on capital punishment in general, drawing from the debate about killing criminals in our respective home countries – South Africa and Germany.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/02-19-the-most-premeditated-of-murders">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The 14-minute trailer of the movie titled &quot;<em>Innocence of Muslims</em>,&quot; a movie that may or may not exist, is poorly made and outright stupid. Anyone of even modest intelligence, Muslim or not, will find it painful to watch. The trailer, produced by Egyptian-born U.S. resident Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, was initially uploaded to YouTube in July 2012. From that time until September it got the attention it deserves: <em>none</em>. Then, on September 8, Egyptian television host Khaled Abdallah reported on the film and showed excerpts of an Arabic version of the trailer. We all know what happened next.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2012/12-03-internet-freedom-under-attack-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 30 November 2012</p>
<p><em>Following is a conversation between Anu Muhammad (an organizer with the National Committee in Bangladesh, which works against resource extraction and imperialism), two members of One Struggle (Daniel and Stephanie McMillan), plus Irtishad Ahmad and Swapan Majhi. It took place in Miami, on  October 18, 2012.</em></p>
<p><strong>Anu Muhammad:</strong> Tell me about your organization.</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie McMillan:</strong> One Struggle actually started 20 years ago against the US occupation of Haiti and the forced return of the people who were leaving the Cedras regime. It first started out only focused on Haiti, and then it became a more internationally focused anti-imperialist group. And it disbanded after a while. But we recently, two years ago, decided to restart it because there was a need— and it seemed like there was a basis— to organize an anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist group.</p>
<p>And then the Occupy movement started a year later. We didn't want to get sucked into that so much that we lost our identity and our autonomy. So we worked within it, but we didn't want to become the Occupy movement. We went there and formed an anti-capitalist caucus within Occupy in South Florida. And we also have a New York chapter starting, and people in different places who are interested.</p>
<p>Four of us just traveled to Haiti and met with workers organizations who are mostly garment workers, but also some agricultural workers fighting against the multinational corporations and factories and imperialist domination overall. I know you're (Anu) focused on the extraction of natural resources, like coal and natural gas, and they have a similar problem where entities like the Clinton &amp; Bush Foundation are buying up a lot of land on the coast of Haiti to build hotels and...</p>
<p><strong>AM:</strong> And it's related to President Clinton?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel: </strong>Oh yeah. He's in Haiti all the time. It's an outgrowth of the Clinton Global Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>AM:</strong> So they are very interested in tourism?</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> Oh yeah. Very interested in tourism and the sweatshops.
<strong>
AM:</strong> Because that &quot;helps people&quot;… (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> I usually say after a hundred years of help, if we are in this situation, we don't need that help. (laughter)</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong> We're still in the same, or worse situation than we were about 100 years ago, based on the occupation, so there is no reason we need that help. And also they just gave a contract to the Prince Charles Foundation to basically rebuild Port-au-Prince, which is the capital of Haiti. And again the Clinton Foundation is involved. So, what they are trying to do is to move all the popular masses outside the capital. So they have the center city Port-au-Prince to for businesses, tourism, and so on. They are trying to displace the masses and put them in the countryside.</p>
<p><strong>AM: </strong>This must be being publicized as a huge development effort for the people of Haiti.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2012/11-30-resistance-to-imperialism-in-bangladesh-and-haiti">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 25 March 2012</p>
<p>In Islam,<strong> </strong><strong>&quot;Apostasy&quot; </strong>(Arabic: <em>irtidad or ridda or Murtadd</em>) means the rejection of <strong>Islam </strong>in word or deed by a person who has been a <strong>Muslim. </strong> An apostate in any pure Islamic country is deserved to be killed, period. Any Muslim who deny this fact is stealthily engaged in <em>Taqiyya</em> (lie and deceptions) or, utterly ignorant about real Islam. Islam is the most intolerant religion on Earth. There are plenty of glaring examples or records of utter intolerance and intimidations from the past and present history of Islam. And this intolerance is rooted in the Quran and Sunnah (Ahadiths-traditions of Prophet Muhammad) and also by the deeds and practices of the early disciples of Prophet Muhammad. In all Sharia-ruled pure Islamic countries such as Saudi  Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait, Sudan etc, all apostates are punished by death penalty.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2012/03-30-punishment-of-apostate-in-islam-is-killing-by-beheading">Read more...</a></p>

<p>On Saturday, May 21, 2011, in the morning, I went out for some work. When I was returning to my house from the highway near the Sayedabad Bus Terminal a man, who appeared to be taller than me with a height of 5 feet 7 inches, stopped me and said, &quot;Please come near to the car&quot;, showing a car waiting on the road facing toward to Bashabo direction. Then, I looked at the car, which was indicated by the person. It was black Mitsubishi Pajero jeep with tinted windows.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2011/06-16-abduction-detention-cruel-and-inhuman-treatment-and-interrogation-by-dgfi">Read more...</a></p>
