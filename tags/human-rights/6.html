<p>Like every other Bangladeshi kid, I also had to study Islamic religion throughout my high school years while my Hindu friends were studying Hindu religion. The Christian boy of the class Bobby Di Costa was the only exception as the school didn't have a Christian teacher.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/11-17-a-violation-of-child-rights">Read more...</a></p>

<p>On 3<sup>rd</sup> of November 2016, three senior most judges of the British high court gave a landmark ruling that the British Parliament alone, not the government, has the ultimate authority to trigger Article 50, the formal process to exit the European Union. The government had so far insisted that it does not require any parliamentary authority as royal prerogative powers were sufficient to proceed. When government's contention was legally challenged by a handful of well intentioned public, the lord chief justice of the high court declared, &quot;The government does not have power under the crown's prerogative to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the EU.&quot;</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/11-05-farcical-democracy-in-the-eu-referendum">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Recently on Facebook, Taslima Nasrin, our own icon of freedom, accused several Bangladeshi Newspaper editors of being cowardly for refusing the publication of an article written to commemorate the tragic murder of the Jordanian satirist and writer Nahid Hattar. I can honestly feel Miss Nasrin's frustration, but however, I personally do not think it is appropriate to hold the editors or the journalists responsible for the appalling state of free speech Bangladeshi writers and freethinkers are suffering from.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/10-27-time-to-take-stand-in-defense-of-free-speech">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 23 October 2016</p>
<p>It is with utmost consternation that we observe that recently Bangladesh Government has filed charges under the infamous Article 57 of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act against publisher Shamsuzzoha Manik. the 73-year old owner of the Bod-dip publishing house. Mr. Manik, was arrested by police on February 15, 2016 at the annual Dhaka Ekushey book fair for publishing and selling books that were deemed offensive to Islam. Since then he was consistently denied bail thus violating the rights guaranteed by the Bangladesh constitution with respect to freedom of expression. We worry about Mr. Manik's failing health during his prolonged detention; our hope is that the authorities would drop the charges against him in view of his deteriorating health. Below we reproduce the statement from PEN America that was issued on June 20, 2016 regarding Mr. Manik.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/10-23-a-disconcerting-act-bangladesh-government-files-charges-against-publisher-shamsuzzoha-manik">Read more...</a></p>

<p>No human word can explain the pain of being raped by the person whom we love and trust most. Unfortunately, almost all of the Bangladeshi women live through this painful reality, and when I say women, I literally mean our sisters and mothers.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/10-09-87-of-our-women-are-rape-victims-what-are-we-a-nation-of-rapists">Read more...</a></p>
