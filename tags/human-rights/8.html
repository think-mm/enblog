    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 28 March 2016</p>
<p>It is a matter of supreme irony that almost to the day 45 years ago when Pakistan unleashed the most barbaric and vicious attack on unarmed civilians of the then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh would have to endure a body blow to its existence from its own judiciary system. Islamisation of Bangladesh has become so deep rooted that even the present progressive government of Bangladesh and the judicial system are scared to antagonise the rampant mullahs of the country. That the government had caved in to appease the mullahs even at the expense of country's constitution indicates a serious existential threat to the country.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/03-28-bangladeshs-existential-threat">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 9 March 2016</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Daily Mail (UK) published a news item entitled &quot;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3473136/Bangladesh-considering-abandoning-Islam-official-religion-following-wake-extremist-attacks.html">Bangladesh Considering Abandoning Islam as Its Official Religion Following Wake of Extremist Attacks</a>.&quot; While it reflects the fact that there will be a hearing in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on the 27th of March to decide whether Islam should remain as Bangladesh's state religion, the heading gives a false hope of solving a major problem. This hearing is not in motion because of the recent rise of Islamic extremism, killing and violence towards the minority. It is not a step taken by the government to fight Islamism, but rather a decision taken by the Supreme Court to look at a petition that was filed 28 years ago.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/03-09-supreme-court-to-decide-whether-islam-should-remain-as-the-state-religion-in-bangladesh-while-government-plays-safe">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 25 February 2016</p>
<p>In the morning of February 26 last year both my wife and I were at our computers in our home office in the greater Washington DC area. I was doing my office work, and she was browsing news on the internet. She was much startled by a news item, and started reading it loudly, so that I could hear it. It was about the murder of Avijit Roy, writer and blogger, at the Ekushe Book Fair in Dhaka. Before she could say &quot;writer and blogger&quot; after &quot;Avijit Roy&quot;, my heart started pounding. I felt like I was having a nightmare; I did not want to believe the news. I screamed, no, no! The next phase of my reaction was mostly swearing at Avijit for going to Bangladesh.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/02-26-lamenting-avijits-jeopardous-trip-to-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The Dissident Blog is a publication of the Swedish PEN that wants to bring to light texts &quot;that can neither be written nor published in the writers' own countries.&quot; The goal is provide these writings a Swedish as well as an international audience. This is an excellent well-developed online magazine that should be on the reading list of all free-thinkers.

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 30 November 2015</p>
<p>Halloween or Hallowe'en, a contraction of all Hallows' Evening, is a celebration brought to the USA by the Irish and Scottish immigrants in 19th century. In the late 20th century this celebration of Halloween was also observed in other western countries. Now, in the present time Halloween is celebrated in almost all the western countries namely, USA, Canada, Ireland, UK, and many other countries. Other than the countries mentioned earlier it is observed being celebrated in countries like Japan in Asia, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. According to the popular belief among the people of Irish, British Welsh community, the pagan god of death Samhain (SAH-win) calls upon all the souls/ spirits of the dead people. According to the belief, in that night all the man made laws are no longer active and the dead spirits are allowed to join the world of alive world. They also believed that, all the dead spirits lived in a land in the form of immortal youngs, and were called &quot;Tir nan Oge&quot;. Some believed that the dead ones lived with angels.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-01-halloween-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 20 November 2015</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) has issued a statement asking for an immediate halt to the execution of the war criminals Salahuddin Quader (SQ) Chowdhury and Ali Hasan Mujahid in Bangladesh. HRW wants to portray this as a political vendetta of the ruling Awami League (AL) against the political parties of Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). HRW laments the lack of fair trial and accuses the court of not allowing witnesses who could testify to the innocence of these two men.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/11-21-editorial-human-rights-watchs-statement-is-unhelpful-towards-establishing-justice">Read more...</a></p>
