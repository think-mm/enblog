    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 24 July 2013</p>
<p>All the famous statements and arguments of Allama Iqbal and M A Jinnah justifying the 'Two Nation Theory' have been proved to be wrong. Had they been alive now, they would have found that their prophecies and convictions about the future of Pakistan (and inadvertently Bangladesh) have been utter disasters.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/07-24-quo-vadis-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 27 June 2013</p>
<p>There is a book originally written in Urdu by Maulana Abdus Sattar and later translated in Bangla by Mustafa Haroon. The Bangla version was published by Islamic Foundation Bangladesh during 1980. This Bangla book is entitled &quot;<em>Aliya Madrasar Itihash</em>&quot;.  Abdus Sattar, in all probability, was an Urdu speaking East Pakistani. The original Urdu book was possibly written during Pakistan era of Bangladesh. In the narration of Bangla &quot;<em>Aliya Madrasar Itihash</em>&quot;, it becomes clear that the concept of &quot;Muslims are separate nation&quot; was very much apparent even in mid-nineteenth century India. It is fact that in the minority Muslim ruled India, this was not an issue. But after 1857, the non-Bengalee Muslim aristocrats suddenly found themselves as a faceless and stateless population. The sentiment percolated to poor Muslims of Bengal without any socio-economic reason which was relevant to their aristocrat non-Bengalee brothers only. The poor Muslims of Bengal simply fell in line on religious ground only.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/06-27-identity-crisis-the-main-cause-of-unhealthy-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 19 June 2013</p>
<p>There was a time when many Bengalees sincerely believed that Mamata Banerjee was the only hope against the perpetual tyranny of Commi parties in West Bengal state of India. She represented courage, sincerity, strength and determination to be with the people in their fight against the injustice of Commi parties. These Commi parties took the people for granted. They implemented Panchayati Raj as it could be used as a tool for social control in vote-based politics of India. The objective of their 'land reform' activities was also the same. They taught serving employees (both in public &amp; private sector) how not to work and constantly agitate against senior officials or management. They brought politics in every sphere of social and administrative matter. They maintained a huge body of goons from village to state capital to bull dodge any discontent or opposition. Use of muscle power, harassing people and even killing political opponents was common place in 34 years of Commi rule in the state.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/06-19-poribartan-in-west-bengal">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 19 May 2013</p>
<p>A book entitled &quot;Islam Dismantled&quot;, written by Sujit Das, was published in 2012. In the book Sujit has portrayed Muhammad as a narcissist. He did so by examining and interpreting the information about the life and conducts of Muhammad available in Qur'an, <em>Hadith </em>and other sources <em>vis-Ã -vis</em> information about narcissism/narcissists available in different sources. The book in question was thought provoking. However, it is natural that no Muslim will like such adverse ('blasphemous' in Islam) remark about the prophet.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/05-19-islam-dismantled-dismantling-sujit-das">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 6 May 2013</p>
<p>Blasphemy in Islam has no reference in Qur'an and <em>Hadith</em>. This is a later creation of Jurists (<em>Ulema</em>). The <em>Ulema</em> are a power hungry lot. They exert authority on all aspects of Muslims' lives. Combination of politicians with <em>Ulema</em> in the issue of blasphemy law is deadly. Why a religion needs stringent blasphemy law to protect it and its Prophet?  It surely does not. But, in the name of protecting Islam and Prophet, the <em>Ulema</em>-politician combination is actually protecting their authoritative and political position.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/05-06-blasphemy-law-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 25 April 2013</p>
<p>Imran Khan, the legendary cricket player and founder of <em>Tehreek-e-Insaf</em> party in Pakistan, has written a book entitled &quot;Pakistan: a personal history&quot;. In the book he describes his personal life from early child hood to 2011 in the backdrop of political situation of Pakistan. Imran is honest when he tells that his religious conviction was very superficial in childhood. From the background of a well-to-do Pakistani extended Muslim family, he shockingly felt the difference between Pakistani and Western society and culture when he went to England for study as a youth.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-25-imran-khan-his-islam">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 12 April 2013</p>
<p>Why are there so many infidels in our country? Almighty <em>Allah</em> had asked us to do <em>Jihad</em> some fourteen hundred years ago. What we have been doing so long? <em>Jihad</em> is the main obligation of all Muslims. Kill the infidels. <em>Jihad</em> is a holy terror approved by Islam. We have pure Islamic blood, we are the best and we will establish <em>Sariah</em> in Bangladesh: <em>Insallah</em>. What is this &quot;<em>Amar Sonar Banglaâ¦</em>&quot;? This is a Hindu song. Hindus are not the only infidels in Bangladesh. There are others like Christians, Buddhists, poets, intellectuals, rationalists and free thinkers who advocate Bengali culture in the form of Hindu &quot;<em>Poila Baishakh</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>Robindra Sangeet</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Nazrul Geeti</em>&quot; etc.. Many of their earlier generation were killed by our Islamic Pakistani brothers in 1971.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-12-an-imaginary-hifajat-i-islam-speech-somewhere-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 1 April 2013</p>
<p>Recently I had a chance to visit a small <em>Vaishnavite</em> (a sect under Hinduism) holy place in Uttar Pradesh, India. I was a guest of a known <em>Vaishnavite</em> devotee there. I enjoyed my hard earned holidays for a couple of days by sleeping and reading the books as internet connectivity was extremely poor to keep me in touch with the world outside. Television was also a big 'no'. The foods served were strictly vegetarian which I did not mind for few a few days.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-01-my-god-is-best-why-to-make-a-fool-out-of-you">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Saturday, 23 March 2013</p>
<p>In a central Myanmar town, the local Buddhist mobs have set fire to homes and mosques of Muslims two days back leaving at least 20 people dead and about 6000 homeless. The President of the country has declared a state of emergency in and around the riot ridden town. The attacks on Muslims by Buddhist hardliners have been occurring off and on in Myanmar since some time. The new found democracy in the country after about fifty years of military rule is facing tuff challenge to maintain law and order. This recent violent atrocity against Muslims in Myanmar reminds last year's brutalities by Buddhists against Rohingya Muslims of the country.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-23-attack-on-muslims">Read more...</a></p>
