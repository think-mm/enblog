    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 16 May 2014</p>
<p>I have written this article as a response to the one written by Mahwash Badar on 12.05.2014 in the blog of The Express Tribune of Pakistan. Badar's article was entitled &quot;Jinnah made a mistake and I am ashamed of being Pakistani&quot;. The article has since been withdrawn. Mahwash Badar wrote &quot;I find myself deeply wishing that Jinnah hadn't made this mistake- that he had thought about the future of Pakistan. He didn't think of obscurantist mindset that he had propelled forward, the countless millions that died at the hand of this vague agenda that fails to unite us as a nation&quot;..... &quot;We share more with our Indian brothers than our ancestral DNA. Our food, language, cloths, lifestyles are more like them than the Arabs we so badly want to mimic and ape&quot;.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-16-why-bangladesh-should-face-the-criticism">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 4 May 2014</p>
<p>This is election time in India and communal talks are selling like hot cakes. Omar Abdullah of National Conference has negated Islamic intolerance in Kashmir valley by telling that Kashmir has given <em>Kashmiriyat</em> to the world. Shazia Ilmi, the Aam Admi Party leader, has told that Indian Muslims are not sufficiently communal. Azam Khan, the fire brand Samajwadi Party leader from Uttar Pradesh has threatened Modi for his Hindu agenda. Lalu, Mulayam, Sonia, Nitish and Mamata have branded Modi as mass murderer of Indian Muslims.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-04-religion-based-politics-an-apology-of-democracy">Read more...</a></p>

<p>India is dancing with democracy. The General Election of the national Parliament is on. One will lose count of total number of political parties (excluding independent candidates) fighting in the election. However, all the political parties have aligned into three groups, viz: BJP led NDA, Congress led UPA and other parties not aligned to NDA or UPA. The last group is most complex and fluid and no one knows which constituent party of this group will behave in what way after the election results are out.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-02-dance-of-democracy-indian-style">Read more...</a></p>

<p>I was selected for the volleyball and cricket teams of school when I was a student of eighth standard. Malik Sahab was our Games Teacher. He was commonly known as Malik Mia. Malik Sahab had no connection with game of any type in remotest way; but he was our Games Teacher. His only role, I observed, was to ask the <em>Chowkider</em> to open the store-room and give us the necessary games materials when required. Malik Sahab was a clean shaven, without skull cap and pant-shirt wearing fair and good looking gentleman.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/04-28-malik-sahab-sultana-i-shall-always-remember-you">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Section 57 of ICT (Amendment) Act-2013 of Bangladesh has made Technology (ICT) Act-2006 ridiculous by allowing law enforcement authorities to arrest any person without warrant. According to Article 57; sub-sections (1) and (2) of the Act, any inflammatory write-ups deliberately published in electronic media on sensitive religious issues to hurt the religious belief can be considered as a crime and those responsible can be slapped with a 10-year imprisonment and a fine of Taka 10 million. It also suggested that the crime is non-bailable.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/04-07-bangladesh-saudi-arabia">Read more...</a></p>

<p>I had a class mate during my school days named Azizur Rehman. To me, in those days, he was Muslim and I was not supposed to eat anything from him. Otherwise I would become <em>Dharmobhrosto</em>. There were a few more Muslim students in our class also. I simply found them very different from rest of us (Hindu boys) in terms of wearing short pajama, skull cap and use of odd words which were not my Bengali. So far I remember, I neither loved nor hated them.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/03-28-my-friend-azizur">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The love birds across the world, in past half a millennium, have been vouching with &quot;What's in a name? that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet;&quot;.

<p>'Adoption' of child in Islam is mainly guided by the socio-economic dimension. It is primarily viewed as an act of charity. It is the social obligation of supporting the orphans. In Islam adopted boy or girl becomes '<em>na-mehram</em>' on reaching adulthood. Adopted boy/girl cannot inherit the property of adoptee parent(s). Taken to the extreme, the adopted boy or girl can marry daughter or son of his/her adoptee parent(s). The whole picture negates the emotional bondage and legal rights of the adopted child and the adoptee parent(s).</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/02-23-why-not-allowed-to-adopt">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 14 February 2014</p>
<p>The history of modern Indian sub-continent is not complete without Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Jinnah's political stature, particularly among Muslims, was as high as Gandhi's among Hindus. From 1939 to the time of partition of India in August 1947, Jinnah relentlessly and forcefully fought for a separate nation for the Muslims of undivided India. He almost single handedly took away Pakistan from the jaws of Congress. He was a very hard bargainer in political arena also and Congress leaders understood that very dearly.  A thoroughly Westernized person, he preferred to be addressed as Mr. Jinnah.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/02-14-mr-jinnah-humiliated">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 26 January 2014</p>
<p>The subjugation of women by men is due to men's hedonistic possessiveness and control freak attitude over women for their stronger physical power. Dozens of references can be given from religious texts of Hinduism and Islam to justify that they describe/advocate and preach sexual, economic, emotional, social and physical exploitation of women by men. In the question of morality and social behaviors in other spheres also many references can be given to hang these two religions as main culprits. Thus religion and morality are neither interdependent nor interlinked.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/01-26-religion-morality-teaching-in-schools-of-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>
