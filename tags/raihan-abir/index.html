    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 6 October 2016</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajoy_Roy">Ajoy Roy</a>, father of murdered atheist writer <a href="https://muktomona.com/avijit/en">Avijit Roy</a>, an University professor and humanist, first started to translate The God Delusion in Bengali in 2007 knowing how important it was to deliver the book's message of science and reason for building a humanist, secular, rational society. The <a href="https://richarddawkins.net/2015/07/the-god-delusion-bengali-translation/">official Bengali translation</a> of the book was later done by Kazi Mahboob Hassan. It was published in 2015 in the Dhaka Book Fair. The Fair is organized each February to celebrate the International Mother Language Day in honor of the Bangladeshis who died to retain Bengali (or Bangla) as the official language of then East Pakistan on February 21, 1952.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/10-06-the-god-delusion-curing-virus-of-faith-for-a-decade">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Bangladesh, especially the secular progressive section of the country, is under attack by two extremely brutal Islamic terror organizations, namely Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and Islamic State (IS). Both of these organizations belong to the Sunni sect and they adhere to tow different strategies to establish Islamic rule in Bangladesh. While IS can be thought of as an authoritarian movement that indiscriminately attacks and kills on Shites, Ahmadiyas, foreign nationals and other non-Muslims, AQIS thinks of itself as a populist movement and focuses on targets who have the ability to motivate people on secularism, atheism or any progressive values that AQIS deem as anti-Islamic or pro US. For the time being AQIS affiliated group in Bangladesh Ansar Bangla is avoiding the killing of Sunnis and ignoring other minority groups such as the Shites. As they concentrate on their progressive targets, they want to create an impact on the mind set of Sunni population who they want to be on their side.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/08-06-commemorating-niloy-neel-perished-by-al-qaedas-sword-immortal-with-the-pen">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 26 July 2016</p>
<p>Mukto-Mona founder and author Avijit Roy's father Ajay Roy; a former university teacher was interviewed by TV journalist Farzana Rupa. The interview was broadcasted on Channel 71 on June 21<sup>st</sup>, 2015. Two days before the interview, in a separate interview with Bangla Tribune, Ajay Roy mentioned the names of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) teacher Farseem Mannan Mohammadey and his group, &quot;Zero to Infinity,&quot; also the team's advisor Jamat-e-Islami activist Trivuz Alam. First and foremost, Ajay explicitly mentioned that he doesn't necessarily believe that Farseem was involved in Avijit's killing. However, Farseem may have played an indirect role in preparing the field for the attack. He also mentioned that the same night Avijit Roy was murdered, &quot;Zero to Infinity&quot; advisor Trivuz Alam celebrated 'one major occasion' at the Radisson Hotel.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/07-26-who-is-the-mastermind-behind-avijits-murder">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 9 March 2016</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Daily Mail (UK) published a news item entitled &quot;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3473136/Bangladesh-considering-abandoning-Islam-official-religion-following-wake-extremist-attacks.html">Bangladesh Considering Abandoning Islam as Its Official Religion Following Wake of Extremist Attacks</a>.&quot; While it reflects the fact that there will be a hearing in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on the 27th of March to decide whether Islam should remain as Bangladesh's state religion, the heading gives a false hope of solving a major problem. This hearing is not in motion because of the recent rise of Islamic extremism, killing and violence towards the minority. It is not a step taken by the government to fight Islamism, but rather a decision taken by the Supreme Court to look at a petition that was filed 28 years ago.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/03-09-supreme-court-to-decide-whether-islam-should-remain-as-the-state-religion-in-bangladesh-while-government-plays-safe">Read more...</a></p>
