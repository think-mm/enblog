<p>One evening, on a busy highway in Dhaka city, a suprobhat bus broke down, and a turag bus rammed into it, though the hit was not very hard, for the bus driver had slammed on the brake on time. If not so, a fatal accident could have happened. Due to the hit, both buses jolted, and some passengers on both buses were injured slightly- passengers at the back of the suprobhat bus were more hurt than others.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/04-10-regionalism">Read more...</a></p>

<p>My high school situated in a country town was a boys' school, for that reason we scarcely saw girls nearby. There was also a girls' school not really far from ours. Often the teaching period of the girls' school came to an end before the proper time, most often in our tiffin period, for the authority of the school was not sound. This was a great opportunity for us to look at the girls of the girls' school through our classroom-window while they were going back, walking in groups, dressed in their school uniform (A blue color chemise, white color pajamas and a white color scarf) to their homes along the earthen road going beside our school premises. This was our only enjoyment in the midst of our tedious lessons, and we kept ourselves waiting ardently for them to come. But having overwhelmed us with distress, now and then they came after our session had been over.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-11-a-faded-image">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Once upon a time, I fell in love with a girl whose nose was carved in the middle of it. I was proud of her, thinking in mind that apart from her there was no girl in all over the world who had a curved nose. Her curved nose, mainly, caused me a great fascination for her.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-03-the-girl-with-curved-nose">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Fahad was thinking randomly about various things not connected with each other with his eyes half closed, sitting on a seat beside a window on a bus full of passengers, and the bus was running along the highway in Dhaka city at night nearly eleven o'clock. All of a sudden, he perceived obscurely that the bus came near a flyover and he was pretty sure that the bus would go over the flyover, because the buses of this service used to go over the flyover. But unlike before, the bus veered its track and then ran along the highway under the flyover. Anyway, Fahad was so much engaged in his haphazard thoughts and his brain was so distracted that he was not able to concentrate on that matter. And all of the passengers on the bus were too fatigued physically and mentally to quarrel with the driver over the matter. Well, the bus continued to run and after going a little distance, abruptly stopped. Fahad opened his eyes and looked idly out of the windscreen in order to know why the bus stopped and perceived that the bus stood in front of a rail crossing and as a caution a bamboo stick was placed diagonally for a train was coming along the rail track though it was not very near. However, weariness of his body made his eyes close fully, he threw himself off in arbitrary thoughts and in a moment started to adrift on the imagination as the sea fig on the wave of the ocean.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/01-08-wrath-and-happiness-over-the-same-incident">Read more...</a></p>
