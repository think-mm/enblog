    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 3 July 2019</p>
<p>As I was having lunch, sitting alone at the dining table, my phone rang and vibrated. So, I took the phone out of my pocket and glanced at the screen. It was her. I cut the call, thinking I would call her after lunch and put the phone on the table. Right away, the phone rang again, her name jerking on the screen. It might be an urgent call. Thus, I might as well have received the call and held the phone to my ear. Just as I said, 'Hello', she scolded me for cutting the call, saying I had been chatting with another girl over a messenger, not giving me a chance to explain why I had done this. She threatened me not to phone me ever in her life if I cut her call ever. When I tried to say after falling for her, I hadn't even looked at the other girls, she stopped me and called me a pathological liar. I swore on her that I didn't lie. Thereupon, she forbade me to swear on her. She told that she should have deserted me before, but she couldn't do it out of sympathy.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2019/07-03-a-phone-call">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 20 June 2019</p>
<p>The batsman hit a six, and the ball landed on a nearby tin-shed house. And Nishat, a fielder, chased the ball. As he was casting around for the ball in the yard, the woman emerged from the room, wearing a sleeveless top. Though the woman was his friend's mother, his friend was living in his maternal uncle's house then, he couldn't take his eyes off the sensual curve of her ample breast and her bare plump arms. In fact, his tiny penis hardened under his trouser.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2019/06-20-the-guilt">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 19 May 2019</p>
<p>Though I called the shopkeeper a few times, he didn't heed me, for he busied himself in rearranging the products on the rack. Then a middle-aged female beggar showed up on my left and begged for money from me. At first, I ignored her, but she continued begging, whereupon I denied her request with a wave of my hand.  Well, when the shopkeeper came to the desk, I said, &quot;please, give me two goldleaf cigarettes,&quot; and he handed me the cigarettes and asked, &quot;Anything else?&quot; I looked over various goods in the shop and noticed the surf excel mini packets. Then I remembered that my clothes were dirty, and they needed washing. So, I told the shopkeeper, &quot;please, give me one surf excel mini-packet, too.&quot; After putting the cigarettes and the surf excel mini-packet into my pocket, I calculated that the shopkeeper owed me 21 tk- 16 tk for two gold leaf cigarettes and 5 tk for one surf excel mini-packet. Opening my wallet, I counted the money and saw that I didn't have 21 tk in change. Thus, I took out a 22 tk- a twenty tk note and a two tk coin and passed them to the shop keeper. He pulled open the cash drawer, put the money, shut the drawer and without giving me the change, returned to his work. I asked for the change from the shopkeeper and saw the beggar again on my right, begging for money from the shop keeper now.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2019/05-19-the-beggar">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 19 May 2019</p>
<p>I traveled to the Chittagong hill tracts once to explore the area. One beautiful afternoon, I set off to take photographs of the surrounding scenery, my camera in my hand. The intoxicating scent of wildflower and the greenery of the area filled my body and mind with joy. As I was strolling along a ridge-way, I noticed smoke drifting from a nearby tribal house. Being curious, I breezed in the house and witnessed a grisly scene. Two tribal women were grilling a slaughtered dog. They had penetrated a bamboo cane through the dog's anus and protruded it through the open cut on the throat, without removing the skin. One woman was holding the bamboo cane at 45- degree angle, her both hands raised above the head, and another one was stirring the fire set on firewood with a spike. Other dogs of the house were watching the process, seated around the fire.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2019/05-19-the-dog">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 16 May 2019</p>
<p>After the sensational foreplay, when he was about to thrust his bulge, she said, moaning, &quot;Wait a moment, please&quot; and moved her pelvis aside. Straight away, she ceased groaning and sat up facing him seated in a sex position- standing on knees, bending down the upper body and holding the bulge with his right hand. Then she grabbed the cell phone, climbed out of the bed, walked to the door and pulled it open. In the meantime, he lost his erection. Turning around, she waved him to come near. When he approached her, she pushed him out of the door and said in a soft tone, &quot;Wait a moment here, please. I won't take long&quot; while pressing the buttons on the cell phone. He glanced at her body and abhorred it because it looked stark naked and alone without the coating of sexual desire.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2019/05-16-life-is-nothing-but-foreplay">Read more...</a></p>

<p>After splashing around in the sea long time, when I eased off, an enormous wave crashed over me. It stroked me down and, to my surprise, I discovered a girl prostrated upon me. Her female organs made my body shudder. But she raised to her feet straightway, apologized for the incident and informed me while floating in the water, an enormous wave threw her at me. Soaking with water, her white shirt became transparent, cling to her toned body and manifested the sensual curves.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2019/04-05-a-strange-love">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 26 December 2018</p>
<p>The second I pressed &quot;send&quot; button on Facebook messenger, a box popped up on my smartphone screen saying, &quot;send failed, this person isn't available right now.&quot; I repeated the action a couple of times and got the same result. When I returned to the main interface of the app, a red dot, an exclamation mark inside, by her name came into my sight. Despite wondering about the matter for long, I couldn't unravel the mystery. At least, chatting with me didn't grow her bored though she never had texted me first. Whenever I sent her a message, except for a few times, she responded without delay. She might have been seeing patients at her chamber at the times.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2018/12-26-a-red-dot">Read more...</a></p>
