    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 9 March 2015</p>
<p>While I generally do not criticize any religious book, the generalized title &quot;Why I Do Not Criticize Religious Books&quot;, would be inappropriate for this article. How is that? The answer would be that I have two major reasons for not criticizing the Quran, but only one major reason for not criticizing the Bible, the Gita, etc. These reasons are the topics of this article.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-09-why-i-do-not-criticize-the-quran">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The title of this article could have been &quot;Why I Am Not a Hindu, or &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot;, etc.; replacing the word Muslim with the name of any other religious group. If I did not want to make the title sound negative, I could have made it something like &quot;Why I Am an Atheist.&quot; But since among the religions of the world, my least preference would be Islam, the religion of the Muslims, I thought the word &quot;Muslim&quot; would fit the title the best.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-02-why-i-am-not-a-muslim">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 27 February 2015</p>
<p>Another most barbaric, most heinous crime had been committed by religious fanatics in the name of religion in full public view on the street of Dhaka. Dr. Avijit Kumar Roy, a Bioengineer presently working in software engineering in the USA, had been brutally murdered as he and his wife were going home at about 9:00 pm on Thursday, 26 February after attending the Ekushey Book Fair and launching his newly published books. They were attacked by two or three assailants with machetes. The Coroner of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, only a short distance away from the crime scene, testified that the attack was an act of a professional killer. Two deep rooted stabs at the back of the skull were so severe that the victim died within a short time from severe bleeding. His wife had also been attacked and she is now in critical condition.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-28-brutality-of-religious-fanatics">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Yesterday, when my wife was reading news from Bangladesh on the internet, she told me that she was reading about the murder of Avijit Roy in Dhaka. I exclaimed to her, &quot;our Avijit?&quot;, got on to internet immediately, and started reading the news myself. I felt like I was having a nightmare, did not want to believe the news to be true.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-28-a-note-of-salute-to-avijit-roy">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Some brain-dead Islamist bigots have murdered Avijit in Dhaka yesterday. I have no word to condemn this heinous crime perpetuated by these Islamist cowards. When such Islamist cowards failed in intellectual discourse with avijit and when they found that their dogma has been proved hollow by Avijit, they settled the score by murdering him. I wish that these Islamist bigots should be put to some sort of genetic engineering process so that at least their progeny become 'HUMAN BEINGS' and not Islamist bigots.
<em>Chhi chhi</em>....
But the two murderers of Avijit only show the tip of ice berg. What humanity should do with millions of such brain-dead Islamists in Bangladesh?

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 8 February 2015</p>
<p>Having observed unremitting political schism, egregious falsification and unbridled corruption by politicians of all shades of colour in Bangladesh for nearly four and half decades, time is now ripe to speak out loud and clear and point out the root cause of national malaise. This is not the country which once inspired and galvanised people of all strands of life to rise up against the repressive, brutal hegemony of Pakistan. People demanded democratic rights, cultural freedom, freedom of expression, and above all a free, fair and honest society where everybody irrespective of creed, colour and religion would live in peace and harmony. What they have got now is exactly the opposite of their demands. But probably people themselves have fundamentally changed and now demanding something else which was not what the country was created for.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-09-a-depraved-state">Read more...</a></p>

<p><strong>{<strong>Postscript from the Author (January 27, 2015):</strong> It is a great disappointment that in spite of the initial consent by the Prime Minister and approval by the Speaker, there was actually no Saraswati Puja at the Bangladesh Parliament. I am not sure why the big leaders' approvals were not implemented. But there is no doubt that this reneging pleases and supports the Islamic/Muslim hate-mongers of Bangladesh.}</strong></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/01-20-saraswati-puja-at-bangladesh-parliament-it-is-progress-indeed">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 21 December 2014</p>
<p>Following the tragic massacre of school children in Pakistan on 16.12.2014, the establishment is showing knee jerk reactions. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has labeled the untimely death of students as his personal loss and strongly spoke for withdrawing moratorium on death sentence and pressed for capital punishment of 55 terrorists whose hanging was withheld earlier. Even the Army Chief of Pakistan has urged for summary execution of 3000 terrorists in next 48 hours. Meanwhile two terrorists in death row have been hanged and Pakistani Army has intensified its military action in restive tribal stronghold of TTP. All sane persons would understand the frustration, sadness, anger and reactive state of mind of both civilian and Army chiefs of Pakistan. The country's soul has been shaken by the brutal attack perpetuated in the name of Jihad by the TTP terrorists on the softest possible target, i.e. school children.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/12-21-afetr-the-massacre">Read more...</a></p>
