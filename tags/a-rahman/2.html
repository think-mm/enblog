    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 18 March 2016</p>
<p>The Muslim world is now in utter chaotic and fragmented state both economically and politically after nearly 1400 years of its existence. The cause of its problem lies not so much in its disharmony with the present world but in the very modality of its existence. As the last of the three monotheistic religions (Judaism and Christianity being the other two), it came into existence as the last and final religion proclaiming the ultimate truth from the Creator, the Almighty God. The message was final and nothing could replace it. Whereas other religions kept pace with time and space and evolved (albeit reluctantly) with scientific development and knowledge, Islam steadfastly refused to reform itself. It is indeed utterly constrained by its own proclamation of finality and thereby invariant to changes.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/03-18-regressive-islam">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 29 December 2015</p>
<p>It is extremely sad and distressing to observe that the liberation war fatality figure has become a political ping-pong game between the two political parties. It had been purposely turned by the vested interests into a test of patriotism! If anyone expresses any scepticism on the fatality figure of three million, then he or she is scorned as anti-Bangladeshi, pro-Pakistani, pro-BNP etc. person and even as a traitor by the ruling party propagandists. On the other hand, even politely listening to 3 million fatality figure in an objective fashion is considered as irrational kowtowing by the vested interests.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-30-war-dead-has-became-a-political-game">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 17 December 2015</p>
<p>[fusion_text]It may be very tempting and, indeed, flattering when a super rich country like Saudi Arabia requests a country like Bangladesh to participate, almost as equal, in the Islamic coalition against terrorism to fight the menace of the Islamic State (IS). Bangladesh may be painted by the vested quarters as a strong and sufficiently grown up in stature among the Islamic nations to be part of a collective action against the evil outfit of IS (also known as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant)). But this image of empowerment is illusory, misleading and could be potentially harmful.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-17-bangladesh-must-shun-the-religious-proxy-war-2">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 27 November 2015</p>
<p>Turkey may be viewed by the developing countries as well as by the Muslim world as an advanced industrialised country very much in tune with the Western democratic system. But this perception is largely misplaced now and very much out of date. The reality of Turkey's position is far from this perception.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/11-28-turkeys-inexorable-descent-to-extremism">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 19 November 2015</p>
<p>The world is undoubtedly at a critical juncture dealing with the grotesque violence of the ISIL/IS. The IS are hell bent on punishing the West for attacking their occupied lands in Iraq and Syria and the West want to put an end to the IS barbarity and have declared war on them in retribution to Paris atrocity.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/11-19-root-causes-of-grotesque-islamic-violence">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 11 November 2015</p>
<p>America may be the only superpower standing, but its diplomacy is getting a real battering now. It is none more so than in the Middle East, where hundreds of billions of tax-payers' dollars and over 4,500 service personnel fatality over a decade or so could not save America from being relegated to playing a second fiddle to Russia. What has caused America to fall from grace precipitously in the Middle East?</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/11-11-american-militarism-and-battered-diplomacy">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 4 October 2015</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the protector of two holiest mosques in Islam, is in abject decadent state. It claims to be the holiest place in Islam, but at the same time it ferments internecine conflicts within Islam. It spent more than 50 billion dollars over the past 45 years or so promoting a fundamentalist religious ideology called Wahhabism throughout the whole world. At the same time, it spent untold hundreds of billions of dollars in aiding and abetting Jihadism and supporting terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, ISIS/ISIL, Taliban, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and so forth against the 'infidels'. The duplicity of Saudi Arabia is just unimaginable.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/10-04-saudi-duplicity-and-inhumanity">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Europe is stunned, simply overwhelmed by the sheer size of the incoming migrants – men, women and children - from African and Asian Muslim countries. At no time since the Second World War, Europe had seen such a large mass migration of humans from other continents to Europe. European conscience and its libertarian principles have been subjected to severest strain, which had never been done before.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/09-12-is-it-isis-sinister-ploy">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The following article, written jointly by me, A Rahman, and India's V T Padmanabhan, has been published in Bangladesh's Energy and Power magazine on 1 Sept 2015. It may be noted that Bangladesh is also embarking on a similar project at Rooppur with the same reactor vendor, Rosatom of Russia.
