    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 12 December 2013</p>
<p>Quader Mollah, the most infamous classmate of mine in my student days in Rajendra College (1964-66,) has become a part of history and probably, nationally and internationally, the most known individual of our class of 1966 superseding even the former cabinet minister of Khaleda Zia's government, Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujaheed who, incidentally, also is facing the gallows if the Supreme Court (SC) does not overturn the verdict. In addition to studying in the class, Quader  was my home mate in a student home where dozens of us used to live, eat and pray (it was made mandatory by the Superintendent) together for two years until I left for the Engineering University after passing the H.S.C. Exam. in 1966 . I wrote a piece on him for DS (February 9, 2013) after the shocking verdict when he was spared on February 5 from the much-expected capital punishment by the honourable judges of the International Crimes Tribunal.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/12-13-quader-mollah-fact-versus-fiction">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 3 April 2013</p>
<p>In a poor country called Bangladesh, recently there has been a surge in heated talk and violent lawlessness. The principal driving forces behind these are the Islamist political parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami, Hifazat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-03-appeasing-the-islamists-an-distressing-sign-for-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The movement that was started by a group of Bangladeshi youth at the Shahbag intersection in Dhaka on February 5, 2013, has grown tremendously. Initially there was just one podium in Shahbag. Now the youth all over the country have erected &quot;Gonojagoran Manchas&quot; (people's awakening podiums) in almost every sub-district of the country. The youth, led by internet savvy bloggers, have been joined by millions of ordinary people. The movement has been praised by noted intellectuals. It has also been supported by the government, even when the youth did not allow leaders of the governing political party to speak from their &quot;Gonojagoran Manchas.&quot; The youth movement has now turned into a people's movement, and it has been coined as 'Spirit of 1971' by a section of the Bangladeshi intelligentsia/media.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-07-the-spirits-of-1971-and-2013">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The rally that was started on February 5, 2013, at the Shahbag intersection in Dhaka was against the sentences that were handed down to Abdul Quader Mollah by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). The organizers and the participants of the rally felt that the sentences were too light for the crimes for which he was convicted.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/02-21-is-shahbag-the-solution">Read more...</a></p>

<p>If Mr. Mollah committed the crimes he was convicted for, and if anyone deserves to die, he does. It is hence not surprising that the death penalty is on everybody's lips in Bangladesh these days. However, we do not wish to comment on the case of Mr. Mollah, as we would hardly be in a position to do so. We leave this case to others more familiar with it and more competent than us. Instead, we will offer some thoughts on capital punishment in general, drawing from the debate about killing criminals in our respective home countries – South Africa and Germany.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/02-19-the-most-premeditated-of-murders">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The restless and clear-headed thinking young generation of Dhaka took to the street to vociferously protest the judgment meted out by court against one of the Jamaati leaders by the name Abdul Quader Mollah who committed crime against humanity during 1971 freedom struggle.  The young generation is not happy that the culprit was given a life sentence.  They wanted to see the convict, A. Quader Mollah walk the gallows.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/02-10-the-advent-of-bangla-spring">Read more...</a></p>
