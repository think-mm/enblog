    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 24 November 2022</p>
<p>The majority people of Bangladesh accuse the Bangladesh police as the most corrupt government organization compared to other law and enforcement organizations. Freedom of speech is the right for every citizen of a democratic country. Recently the murderers of Avijit Roy fled after they are convicted by court. It is quite surprising that any convicted criminal could escape without any kind of internal assistance. It can be assumed that they could not get away by themselves rather they were helped to run away through internal or external intervention. It just cannot happen otherwise. Also, it seems the news was deliberately downplayed by the Bangladeshi Media.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2022/11-23-avijit-roy-assassins-escape">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 14 June 2022</p>
<p>A derogatory statement from India has recently come into spotlight in the international media as a hot potato of the world ,and Nupur Sharma, BJP Parliament member of India, claimed on her tweet that the context was during TV debate Mahadev, Hindu deity, was being disrespected and insulted. In that context, she responded using derogatory statement. Each party uses religious sentiments at the end of the day to win in the debate.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2022/06-03-religious-politics-india">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 26 January 2017</p>
<p>The relationship between Bangladesh and India mainly concentrates on economics and often on divisions- religious divides, land and border disputes, export-import imbalance, sovereignty, nationalism, difference between political trends and often hatred.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2017/01-26-india-bangladesh-relationship-look-beyond-economics">Read more...</a></p>

<p>As school education makes a comeback on the public debate agenda for all the wrong reasons, and none but the Islamic fundamentalists have come out to defend the government yet, here's a message for the Awami League policy makers: Open your eyes, stop substituting BNP-Jamat, act like the secular center left party it meant to be, show some leadership and do not even dare to play opportunistic games with our kids future for short term political greed. It might be of interest for few, but in the long term the social and economic consequences of such selfish practice will be severe, and you'll be judged for that, even long after you're gone.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2017/01-17-do-not-play-with-our-kids-future">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 11 October 2015</p>
<p>India's beef ban came into spotlight recently in horrible ways. On September 30, 2015, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34398433">a mob of more than 100 people lynched a 50 years old Muslim man</a>, named Mohammad Akhlaq, in Uttar Pradesh. They also roughed up his family, including seriously injuring his 22 years old son. What was the reason? There was a rumor that the family had beef in their fridge. On October 8, 2015, <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/969439/lawmaker-beaten-up-for-hosting-beef-party-in-indian-kashmir/">an MLA of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, named Engineer Rashid, was beaten up by some of his colleagues</a> for hosting a party where beef was served. On October 9, 2015, <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/india-beef-controversy-fresh-violence-uttar-pradesh-over-rumours-cow-slaughter-1523320">a mob beat up two youths and clashed with the police</a> in Uttar Pradesh. What was the problem there? There was a rumor that a cow was slaughtered and skinned.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/10-12-the-shame-of-ban-on-beef-in-secular-india">Read more...</a></p>
