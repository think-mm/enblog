    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 15 October 2014</p>
<p>M J Akbar, the well known Indian journalist, has written a book entitled, &quot;Tinderbox â€“ the past and future of Pakistan&quot;. It is a scholarly exposition of Pakistan's yesterday which gives hints for its tomorrow. Though no new information is available in the book, except some details about Pakistani terrorist groups and killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, it compels one to revisit and recapitulate the known facts in present context.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/10-15-tinderbox-the-past-and-future-of-pakistan">Read more...</a></p>

<p>That Bengalis are cowards is a common saying in India outside West Bengal. That West Bengal has only a few industries in comparison with many other States of India is a naked fact. In this background I faced two uncomfortable questions from my daughter.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/08-12-what-harm-did-politics-to-west-bengal">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 27 May 2014</p>
<p>Suzanna Arundhati Roy (writer of &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; which was published in 1997) labels India as a &quot;Hindu Corporate State&quot;. She criticizes Modi and RSS whenever she gets a chance. She markets '<em>Babri Mosque</em>' and '<em>Gujarat riot</em>' as symbols of her secular intellectuality. She bypasses '<em>Godhara incident</em>' with great vagueness; but speaks about second by second details of Gujarat riot. She does not speak of Kasab and cries for Afzal Guru. She does not remember Mumbai serial blasts. She has not heard of 'Indian Mujahidin'. She is pathologically silent about the hijack of Air India plane to Kandhahar.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-27-arundhati-roy-woman-of-small-mind">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 2 May 2014</p>
<p>India is dancing with democracy. The General Election of the national Parliament is on. One will lose count of total number of political parties (excluding independent candidates) fighting in the election. However, all the political parties have aligned into three groups, viz: BJP led NDA, Congress led UPA and other parties not aligned to NDA or UPA. The last group is most complex and fluid and no one knows which constituent party of this group will behave in what way after the election results are out.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-02-dance-of-democracy-indian-style">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 23 February 2014</p>
<p>'Adoption' of child in Islam is mainly guided by the socio-economic dimension. It is primarily viewed as an act of charity. It is the social obligation of supporting the orphans. In Islam adopted boy or girl becomes '<em>na-mehram</em>' on reaching adulthood. Adopted boy/girl cannot inherit the property of adoptee parent(s). Taken to the extreme, the adopted boy or girl can marry daughter or son of his/her adoptee parent(s). The whole picture negates the emotional bondage and legal rights of the adopted child and the adoptee parent(s).</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/02-23-why-not-allowed-to-adopt">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 17 January 2014</p>
<p>Suchitra Sen, the brightest icon and the 'queen of hearts' of Bengali films, sadly passed away on Friday, 17 January 2014, aged 82 in Kolkata, India. She succumbed to the respiratory malfunction and breathed her last at 8:25am this morning. She was born as Rama Desgupta in Pabna, Bangladesh on 6 April 1931. She left behind innumerable admirers of all ages on both sides of the border. It is a very sad day indeed for Bengali culture in general and Bengali film industry in particular.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/01-17-passing-away-of-suchitra-sen">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Reports from India say that Sachin Tendulkar, the legendary cricketer who very recently retired from the game at the age of 40 years, has been awarded &quot;Bharat Ratna&quot; the highest civilian award in India. Sachin has been an idol in India and cricketing world. His performance in the game of cricket was un-parallel. In his 24 years career as India's cricketer, Sachin has achieved many peaks. He has been non-controversial to the point of being silent in his classical politically correct posture. Such posture reflected escapism at times. From cricket he has earned a lot and shall do so through endorsements and cricket commentary also even after retirement. I am not aware of the conditionalities about &quot;Bharat Ratna&quot;. But:</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/11-20-height-of-madness">Read more...</a></p>
