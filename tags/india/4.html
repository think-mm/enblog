    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 19 June 2013</p>
<p>There was a time when many Bengalees sincerely believed that Mamata Banerjee was the only hope against the perpetual tyranny of Commi parties in West Bengal state of India. She represented courage, sincerity, strength and determination to be with the people in their fight against the injustice of Commi parties. These Commi parties took the people for granted. They implemented Panchayati Raj as it could be used as a tool for social control in vote-based politics of India. The objective of their 'land reform' activities was also the same. They taught serving employees (both in public &amp; private sector) how not to work and constantly agitate against senior officials or management. They brought politics in every sphere of social and administrative matter. They maintained a huge body of goons from village to state capital to bull dodge any discontent or opposition. Use of muscle power, harassing people and even killing political opponents was common place in 34 years of Commi rule in the state.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/06-19-poribartan-in-west-bengal">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 7 March 2013</p>
<p>BNP Chief Ms Khaleda (leader of opposition) declined to meet the President of India during the latter's state visit to Bangladesh this week. Such behavior on the part of Ms Khaleda not only speaks volumes about her political compulsion, but also gives her true face as fountain head of <em>Jamaat</em>.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-07-bnp-jamaat-will-they-hear">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Saturday, 2 February 2013</p>
<p>As per the news report from Kolkata (India), Mr Salman Rushdie was not allowed to visit the city on 1st February 2013 for promoting the film based on his novel 'Midnight's Children'. The over-enthusiastic and &quot;look-at-me Islamo-philic&quot; Chief Minister of the Indian state, Ms Mamata Banerjee, has asked her police not to let Mr Rushdie enter Kolkata. The reason is obvious as <em>Ulema</em> consider Rhusdie's writing to be blasphemous. Moreover, Rushdie is an apostate from Islam. The <em>Sharia</em> (Laws of Allah) is specifically cruel for such person. Some years back Ms Taslima Nasreen was bundled out of Kolkata for her  blasphemous writings. The ruling dispositions of West Bengal have been too eager to pamper the <em>Ulema</em>. In both cases, decisions were taken so that Muslim sentiment is not hurt. Let us examine what that Muslim sentiment is.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/02-02-sorry-mr-rushdie">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 14 January 2013</p>
<p>The Hindu religious festival (ritual) &quot;<em>Maha Kumbha</em>&quot; has started on 14th January 2013 in Allahabad, India. It is a 12 yearly event. About 1.1 crores of Hindu devotees are expected to take holy dip in <em>Trveni Sangam</em> in Allahabad. Hindus consider <em>Trveni Sangam</em>, the confluence of three rivers, viz Ganga, Yamuna and under-ground Saraswati, a very holy place.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/01-14-maha-kumbha-holy-dip-in-filthy-water">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 24 September 2009</p>
<p>No doubt for last two days, arrest of Kobad Ghandhi, a politburo member of the Maoist rebel group rocked the national media. Definitely what stirred the most is his sacrifice of career and Persian family fortune which he and his wife inherited during 1970. After he was baptized in Leninism in London, he continued to serve oppressed rural people of India and finally joined Maoist rebels during 1980's. One may think that rebels are just trigger happy gun master fighting against either Indian military force or Salua Julum but BBC interview of Kobad in 2008 clearly speaks volume for his work among the oppressed rural people in Madhya Pradesh.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2009/09-24-che-guevera-and-kobad-ghandi-why-do-they-mislead">Read more...</a></p>
