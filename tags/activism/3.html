<p>Just a day after being inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, Donald J Trump and his band of right-wing fascists were fearsomely warned by millions of women from all across the globe that misogyny is not an accepted norm, and any attempt of further degradation of women would be challenged vigorously.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2017/02-05-womens-rights-is-not-a-pity-party">Read more...</a></p>

<p>As school education makes a comeback on the public debate agenda for all the wrong reasons, and none but the Islamic fundamentalists have come out to defend the government yet, here's a message for the Awami League policy makers: Open your eyes, stop substituting BNP-Jamat, act like the secular center left party it meant to be, show some leadership and do not even dare to play opportunistic games with our kids future for short term political greed. It might be of interest for few, but in the long term the social and economic consequences of such selfish practice will be severe, and you'll be judged for that, even long after you're gone.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2017/01-17-do-not-play-with-our-kids-future">Read more...</a></p>

<p>There is no room for argument, that the child marriage epidemic in Bangladesh is a concern for a leader as ambitious as Seikh Hasina, whose leadership is often praised and seen as pivotal for Bangladesh's success in gender equality and in eradication of poverty.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/12-12-bangladesh-do-not-legitimize-paedophilia">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Like every other Bangladeshi kid, I also had to study Islamic religion throughout my high school years while my Hindu friends were studying Hindu religion. The Christian boy of the class Bobby Di Costa was the only exception as the school didn't have a Christian teacher.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/11-17-a-violation-of-child-rights">Read more...</a></p>

<p>On 3<sup>rd</sup> of November 2016, three senior most judges of the British high court gave a landmark ruling that the British Parliament alone, not the government, has the ultimate authority to trigger Article 50, the formal process to exit the European Union. The government had so far insisted that it does not require any parliamentary authority as royal prerogative powers were sufficient to proceed. When government's contention was legally challenged by a handful of well intentioned public, the lord chief justice of the high court declared, &quot;The government does not have power under the crown's prerogative to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the UK to withdraw from the EU.&quot;</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/11-05-farcical-democracy-in-the-eu-referendum">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 25 September 2016</p>
<p>I do not know – how many people, who watched the Democratic National Committee (DNC) convention in Philadelphia, noticed resounding boos… from the diehard Bernie-supporters at the moment Bernie endorsed Hillary for President. So, it was clear that Bernie supporters were disappointed with him for his public endorsement of Hillary Clinton. On the other hand, Ted Cruz was also showered with boos in the Republican convention at Cleveland, Ohio; that was for not endorsing the front runner, Mr. Trump. So, these two boos are for two different reasons. Most diehard democrats and republicans may have missed these moments, but, it was a striking moment for me.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/09-26-take-home-messages-of-the-recent-political-conventions-in-usa">Read more...</a></p>
