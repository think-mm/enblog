<p>By the middle of 2015, after nearly four years of vicious Syrian conflict and at the height of ISIL's (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) march towards Baghdad to make the Islamic Caliphate a reality, refugees started pouring out of Syria and Iraq in large numbers. Nearly two years earlier, the self-proclaimed Caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the ISIL Caliphate, boastfully announced that ISIL would flood Europe with Muslim refugees and Islamists from Asia and Africa and Islamise the European continent.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/09-24-is-angela-merkel-an-angel-or-an-agent-for-damage-and-destruction">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 18 March 2016</p>
<p>The Muslim world is now in utter chaotic and fragmented state both economically and politically after nearly 1400 years of its existence. The cause of its problem lies not so much in its disharmony with the present world but in the very modality of its existence. As the last of the three monotheistic religions (Judaism and Christianity being the other two), it came into existence as the last and final religion proclaiming the ultimate truth from the Creator, the Almighty God. The message was final and nothing could replace it. Whereas other religions kept pace with time and space and evolved (albeit reluctantly) with scientific development and knowledge, Islam steadfastly refused to reform itself. It is indeed utterly constrained by its own proclamation of finality and thereby invariant to changes.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/03-18-regressive-islam">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 9 March 2016</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Daily Mail (UK) published a news item entitled &quot;<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3473136/Bangladesh-considering-abandoning-Islam-official-religion-following-wake-extremist-attacks.html">Bangladesh Considering Abandoning Islam as Its Official Religion Following Wake of Extremist Attacks</a>.&quot; While it reflects the fact that there will be a hearing in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh on the 27th of March to decide whether Islam should remain as Bangladesh's state religion, the heading gives a false hope of solving a major problem. This hearing is not in motion because of the recent rise of Islamic extremism, killing and violence towards the minority. It is not a step taken by the government to fight Islamism, but rather a decision taken by the Supreme Court to look at a petition that was filed 28 years ago.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/03-09-supreme-court-to-decide-whether-islam-should-remain-as-the-state-religion-in-bangladesh-while-government-plays-safe">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 29 December 2015</p>
<p>It is extremely sad and distressing to observe that the liberation war fatality figure has become a political ping-pong game between the two political parties. It had been purposely turned by the vested interests into a test of patriotism! If anyone expresses any scepticism on the fatality figure of three million, then he or she is scorned as anti-Bangladeshi, pro-Pakistani, pro-BNP etc. person and even as a traitor by the ruling party propagandists. On the other hand, even politely listening to 3 million fatality figure in an objective fashion is considered as irrational kowtowing by the vested interests.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-30-war-dead-has-became-a-political-game">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Recently there has been a lot of media uproar on the claim that the United States of America was unfair to the Muslims and discriminated against them. It is also claimed that the USA hated Muslims.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-27-is-america-unfair-to-muslims">Read more...</a></p>

<p>[fusion_text]It may be very tempting and, indeed, flattering when a super rich country like Saudi Arabia requests a country like Bangladesh to participate, almost as equal, in the Islamic coalition against terrorism to fight the menace of the Islamic State (IS). Bangladesh may be painted by the vested quarters as a strong and sufficiently grown up in stature among the Islamic nations to be part of a collective action against the evil outfit of IS (also known as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant)). But this image of empowerment is illusory, misleading and could be potentially harmful.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-17-bangladesh-must-shun-the-religious-proxy-war-2">Read more...</a></p>
