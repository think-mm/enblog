    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 16 July 2014</p>
<p>I know a Muslim youth in his early thirties. He is from a rich, land owning, <em>Ashraf</em> family of India. Though a third generation Western educated Muslim, he is extremely conscious of his <em>Ashraf</em> linage. He is a clean shaven and non-practicing Muslim. He never went to <em>Madrassa</em> but did his schooling from a Christian boarding school. He can read English Qur'an only. He does not pray or keep <em>Ramadan</em> fast.  His father and uncles are highly placed in Civil Services. He is very articulate, does a good job and modern in outfit.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/07-16-ardent-fundamentalist">Read more...</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify"><b>Ratan Barua left this world on Tuesday, April 1, 2014 at 6 AM. This write up is for those of you who did not get to know him before. I know - I can't tell you enough or all about him, but - I will try my best to give you a glimpse of his personality in this short write up.  He was unique in so many ways. I am not sure how to describe him; he was just different from most of us; never married, never had fascination for family-life; totally selfless. Thoughts of wellbeing of others always drove him forward. Whenever someone in the New York/tri-state area needed help for any reason, the first person he/she would remember to call for help was Ratan Barua. I am not sure how his void will be filled going forward.  </b></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/04-03-ratan-barua-my-friend">Read more...</a></p>

<p>'Adoption' of child in Islam is mainly guided by the socio-economic dimension. It is primarily viewed as an act of charity. It is the social obligation of supporting the orphans. In Islam adopted boy or girl becomes '<em>na-mehram</em>' on reaching adulthood. Adopted boy/girl cannot inherit the property of adoptee parent(s). Taken to the extreme, the adopted boy or girl can marry daughter or son of his/her adoptee parent(s). The whole picture negates the emotional bondage and legal rights of the adopted child and the adoptee parent(s).</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/02-23-why-not-allowed-to-adopt">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 3 January 2014</p>
<p>In my 32 years in the United States, my social life was most pressing during my time in the greater Boston area. That was 1989-1992, when I was a young lecturer at Northeastern University. When my wife and I arrived there, we knew quite a few Bangladeshis from our Dhaka University days in the 1970s and 1980s. Through them we came to know quite a few more. Most of our friends and acquaintances were highly qualified, both professionals and graduate students. Through social interactions with them, I got involved in the Bangladesh Association of New England (BANE), a Boston-centric group.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/01-04-politics-and-democracy-the-bangladeshi-style">Read more...</a></p>

<p>For better or for worse, people think in boxes. They have boxes for things, and they have boxes for people: Bengali, westerner, Muslim, Hindu, atheist, Asian, White, Black… Curiously, one pair of boxes seems to play a particularly important role in people's lives: Think about it... What was the first-ever question that anybody has asked about you? Likely, the answer is: &quot;Is it a boy or a girl?&quot; And, likely, that question was asked before you were even born. But does it really matter whether you are a man or a woman? And should it matter?</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/09-27-masud-i-am-a-woman">Read more...</a></p>
