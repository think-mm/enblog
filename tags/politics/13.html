    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 12 August 2014</p>
<p>That Bengalis are cowards is a common saying in India outside West Bengal. That West Bengal has only a few industries in comparison with many other States of India is a naked fact. In this background I faced two uncomfortable questions from my daughter.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/08-12-what-harm-did-politics-to-west-bengal">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The old story of human despair due to the Muslim-Jew conflict continues in the so-called holy land. In the last few weeks more than <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28497439">800 Palestinians and dozens of Israelis have been killed</a> by the two fighting parties (1). The tolls on both sides include innocent children, who are neither fighters nor hate-mongers nor policy makers by any means.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/07-26-misery-in-the-fraudulent-holy-land">Read more...</a></p>

<p>A news report from Washington says: &quot;Close on the heels of the spectacular BJP win in the general election, Hindu-American activists in the United States have for the first time, under the banner of a political action committee, publicly endorsed a slate of congressional candidates in the 2014 US primaries.&quot;</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/06-02-hindu-americans">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Probably, we are the only nation in the world who has to fight every day to find out our country. No, it doesn't mean that we lost our country geographically every day, but there is a far distance between the Bangladesh in our mind and in front of our eyes. 'Bangladesh' is a name of glorious history, a deep rooted cultural phenomena and obviously a name of interaction between various ethnic groups. The common people of Bangladesh never believe in any kind of anarchy. Though they are religious, but as far as I can find their visions throughout their statements in various references and oral interviews, they never relay on any fundamental forces. So, it's a big question now, how these fundamentalist groups make their uprising in our state. The straight answer is 'with the fresh aid of existing political forces'. If we look at the history of growing fundamentalism in Bangladesh after the liberation period, we find the state machine as a key force to make this happen. After the brutal assassination of the father of the nation, state directly played the role to build up the fundamentalist forces. This role of state is still in the van. As a reason, unfortunately, Bangladesh in the dream of secular forces is just like a stage play; there is no reflection in the present ruling or administration.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-30-hefajat-government-tom-jerry-in-new-version">Read more...</a></p>

<p>I have written this article as a response to the one written by Mahwash Badar on 12.05.2014 in the blog of The Express Tribune of Pakistan. Badar's article was entitled &quot;Jinnah made a mistake and I am ashamed of being Pakistani&quot;. The article has since been withdrawn. Mahwash Badar wrote &quot;I find myself deeply wishing that Jinnah hadn't made this mistake- that he had thought about the future of Pakistan. He didn't think of obscurantist mindset that he had propelled forward, the countless millions that died at the hand of this vague agenda that fails to unite us as a nation&quot;..... &quot;We share more with our Indian brothers than our ancestral DNA. Our food, language, cloths, lifestyles are more like them than the Arabs we so badly want to mimic and ape&quot;.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-16-why-bangladesh-should-face-the-criticism">Read more...</a></p>

<p>I am actually very frustrated about Bangladesh.

<p>This is election time in India and communal talks are selling like hot cakes. Omar Abdullah of National Conference has negated Islamic intolerance in Kashmir valley by telling that Kashmir has given <em>Kashmiriyat</em> to the world. Shazia Ilmi, the Aam Admi Party leader, has told that Indian Muslims are not sufficiently communal. Azam Khan, the fire brand Samajwadi Party leader from Uttar Pradesh has threatened Modi for his Hindu agenda. Lalu, Mulayam, Sonia, Nitish and Mamata have branded Modi as mass murderer of Indian Muslims.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-04-religion-based-politics-an-apology-of-democracy">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 2 May 2014</p>
<p>India is dancing with democracy. The General Election of the national Parliament is on. One will lose count of total number of political parties (excluding independent candidates) fighting in the election. However, all the political parties have aligned into three groups, viz: BJP led NDA, Congress led UPA and other parties not aligned to NDA or UPA. The last group is most complex and fluid and no one knows which constituent party of this group will behave in what way after the election results are out.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-02-dance-of-democracy-indian-style">Read more...</a></p>
