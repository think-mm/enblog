    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 25 February 2016</p>
<p>In the morning of February 26 last year both my wife and I were at our computers in our home office in the greater Washington DC area. I was doing my office work, and she was browsing news on the internet. She was much startled by a news item, and started reading it loudly, so that I could hear it. It was about the murder of Avijit Roy, writer and blogger, at the Ekushe Book Fair in Dhaka. Before she could say &quot;writer and blogger&quot; after &quot;Avijit Roy&quot;, my heart started pounding. I felt like I was having a nightmare; I did not want to believe the news. I screamed, no, no! The next phase of my reaction was mostly swearing at Avijit for going to Bangladesh.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/02-26-lamenting-avijits-jeopardous-trip-to-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 30 November 2015</p>
<p>Halloween or Hallowe'en, a contraction of all Hallows' Evening, is a celebration brought to the USA by the Irish and Scottish immigrants in 19th century. In the late 20th century this celebration of Halloween was also observed in other western countries. Now, in the present time Halloween is celebrated in almost all the western countries namely, USA, Canada, Ireland, UK, and many other countries. Other than the countries mentioned earlier it is observed being celebrated in countries like Japan in Asia, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. According to the popular belief among the people of Irish, British Welsh community, the pagan god of death Samhain (SAH-win) calls upon all the souls/ spirits of the dead people. According to the belief, in that night all the man made laws are no longer active and the dead spirits are allowed to join the world of alive world. They also believed that, all the dead spirits lived in a land in the form of immortal youngs, and were called &quot;Tir nan Oge&quot;. Some believed that the dead ones lived with angels.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-01-halloween-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 6 November 2015</p>
<p>This year to date, six people in Bangladesh who have promoted a natural and observation-based view of humanity's place in history have been hacked to death by those who seek to impose a particular supernatural view of humanity's origins and destiny. Other &quot;free thinkers&quot; in that country have been severely injured and threatened. Previously confined to authors and translators, last weekend witnessed the same method of execution applied to publishers of science-based books. These targeted killings have generated both fear and bravery among the community of rationalist advocates in the country. During the same period, two foreigners not associated with science education have also been killed in the south Asian nation, but by a different method of execution: drive-by shooting. While there is debate about whether all these killings were linked, death by hacking has been exclusive to the former group.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/11-06-murderous-attacks-on-bangladeshi-science-writers-and-publishers">Read more...</a></p>
