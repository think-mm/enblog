    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 5 August 2014</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that out of three desert-based religions, Christianity and Islam are Missionary in nature. The third one i.e. Judaism is non-Missionary like river-based religion of Hinduism (<em>Brahmanism</em>). Both Christianity and Islam originated from respective single personality (Jesus and Muhammad) but Judaism has more than one prophet who came over a long period of time. Hinduism also originated from multiple personalities. This singleness of prophet or originator had made Christianity and Islam Missionary. Similarly the river-based religion of Buddhism is also Missionary in nature.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/08-05-why-islam-is-violent">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The old story of human despair due to the Muslim-Jew conflict continues in the so-called holy land. In the last few weeks more than <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28497439">800 Palestinians and dozens of Israelis have been killed</a> by the two fighting parties (1). The tolls on both sides include innocent children, who are neither fighters nor hate-mongers nor policy makers by any means.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/07-26-misery-in-the-fraudulent-holy-land">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 16 July 2014</p>
<p>I know a Muslim youth in his early thirties. He is from a rich, land owning, <em>Ashraf</em> family of India. Though a third generation Western educated Muslim, he is extremely conscious of his <em>Ashraf</em> linage. He is a clean shaven and non-practicing Muslim. He never went to <em>Madrassa</em> but did his schooling from a Christian boarding school. He can read English Qur'an only. He does not pray or keep <em>Ramadan</em> fast.  His father and uncles are highly placed in Civil Services. He is very articulate, does a good job and modern in outfit.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/07-16-ardent-fundamentalist">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 8 July 2014</p>
<p>The European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg upheld the French government's ban on wearing burqa or niqab in its ruling on 1 July 2014. A French Law on religious headgear banned wearing burqa or niqab in public in 2010. The European Court ruling states that the law does not breach Muslim women's Human Rights and consequently there is no reason why the ban should not be upheld. This is a landmark ruling and it could prompt other European and Western countries to consider banning such attires without the risk of legal challenges.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/07-08-should-britain-consider-banning-burqa-and-niqab">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 30 June 2014</p>
<p>In 'Protham Alo' of 24th June 2014 an article entitled &quot;<em>Miraj Maha Nabir Shretha Mujija</em>&quot; written by Dr Muhammad Abdul Munim Khan (a university Assistant Professor, researcher and columnist) was published. There was nothing new in the article. It was the as-usual-things describing the nocturnal celestial journey of Prophet. The article ended with the standard reminder that daily prayer is the <em>Miraj</em> gift of Allah to Muslims and hence it is obligatory for all Muslims.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/06-30-miraj-the-important-event-in-prophets-life">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Probably, we are the only nation in the world who has to fight every day to find out our country. No, it doesn't mean that we lost our country geographically every day, but there is a far distance between the Bangladesh in our mind and in front of our eyes. 'Bangladesh' is a name of glorious history, a deep rooted cultural phenomena and obviously a name of interaction between various ethnic groups. The common people of Bangladesh never believe in any kind of anarchy. Though they are religious, but as far as I can find their visions throughout their statements in various references and oral interviews, they never relay on any fundamental forces. So, it's a big question now, how these fundamentalist groups make their uprising in our state. The straight answer is 'with the fresh aid of existing political forces'. If we look at the history of growing fundamentalism in Bangladesh after the liberation period, we find the state machine as a key force to make this happen. After the brutal assassination of the father of the nation, state directly played the role to build up the fundamentalist forces. This role of state is still in the van. As a reason, unfortunately, Bangladesh in the dream of secular forces is just like a stage play; there is no reflection in the present ruling or administration.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/05-30-hefajat-government-tom-jerry-in-new-version">Read more...</a></p>
