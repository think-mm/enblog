    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 8 February 2015</p>
<p>Having observed unremitting political schism, egregious falsification and unbridled corruption by politicians of all shades of colour in Bangladesh for nearly four and half decades, time is now ripe to speak out loud and clear and point out the root cause of national malaise. This is not the country which once inspired and galvanised people of all strands of life to rise up against the repressive, brutal hegemony of Pakistan. People demanded democratic rights, cultural freedom, freedom of expression, and above all a free, fair and honest society where everybody irrespective of creed, colour and religion would live in peace and harmony. What they have got now is exactly the opposite of their demands. But probably people themselves have fundamentally changed and now demanding something else which was not what the country was created for.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-09-a-depraved-state">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 28 January 2015</p>
<p>In an obscure corner of Russia, a local court banned &quot;Geeta&quot; (the famous Hindu Religious Book) last year for being a book which describes and promotes violence. The members of RSS and similar Hindu organizations in India became vocal with protests against that court verdict. But as the said court was far away, Indian Hindu bigots could not engage in violent activities on that issue. Obviously, many Hindus felt hurt for labeling Geeta as a book of violence.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/01-28-the-geeta-and-violence">Read more...</a></p>

<p><strong>{<strong>Postscript from the Author (January 27, 2015):</strong> It is a great disappointment that in spite of the initial consent by the Prime Minister and approval by the Speaker, there was actually no Saraswati Puja at the Bangladesh Parliament. I am not sure why the big leaders' approvals were not implemented. But there is no doubt that this reneging pleases and supports the Islamic/Muslim hate-mongers of Bangladesh.}</strong></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/01-20-saraswati-puja-at-bangladesh-parliament-it-is-progress-indeed">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 21 December 2014</p>
<p>Following the tragic massacre of school children in Pakistan on 16.12.2014, the establishment is showing knee jerk reactions. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has labeled the untimely death of students as his personal loss and strongly spoke for withdrawing moratorium on death sentence and pressed for capital punishment of 55 terrorists whose hanging was withheld earlier. Even the Army Chief of Pakistan has urged for summary execution of 3000 terrorists in next 48 hours. Meanwhile two terrorists in death row have been hanged and Pakistani Army has intensified its military action in restive tribal stronghold of TTP. All sane persons would understand the frustration, sadness, anger and reactive state of mind of both civilian and Army chiefs of Pakistan. The country's soul has been shaken by the brutal attack perpetuated in the name of Jihad by the TTP terrorists on the softest possible target, i.e. school children.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/12-21-afetr-the-massacre">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Isn't it intriguing that, when Bangladesh is celebrating the victory month, Pakistan is in shock due to the killing of almost 150 people, mostly students, in a military-run school?</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/12-17-the-massacre-at-a-school-in-a-failed-state">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 15 December 2014</p>
<p>Mehdi Masroor Biswas, the young Bengali Muslim 'laptop Jihadi' from Kolkata was arrested in Bangalore (India) a couple of days back. Mehdi was working in an MNC there. He comes from a middle class family and has a bachelor degree in electronics. Mekhail Biswas, father of Mehdi, quite reasonably, doubted that it could be a case of 'mistaken identity'. The same reaction we observed from the father of Bangladeshi (Jatrabari, Dhaka) student in US who was arrested as potential terrorist last year. A father cannot think anything bad about his son. No father will first like to accept the fact that his son has advanced stage of 'cancer'. The denial comes naturally. All sensible persons will empathize with Mekhail. But reality is too bitter.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/12-15-laptop-jihadi-islam">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 7 December 2014</p>
<p>As the debate continues to swirl around secularism, albeit with ebbing intensity, but still provoking a loose nerve or two, an intriguing question demands an answer. Is India secular because Gandhi was secular, or was Gandhi secular because India is secular? What precisely do we mean by secularism?</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/12-07-hear-it-indian-secularism-is-both-enduring-audible">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of animals are going to be slaughtered in Nepal in the name of sacrifice to god in Hindu religion. Just see the gruesome pictures in the attached article published today in the Daily Mail in Britain.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/11-29-religious-slaughter-of-thousands-of-animals-in-nepal">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 19 November 2014</p>
<p>Anybody can change his religion. It is his personal matter. But Kabir Suman's assertive Muslimness after conversion to Islam has become possible as Hinduism does not have any concept of 'apostasy' and Hindu people around him in Kolkata are not sufficiently narrow minded to poke in to his personal religious affiliation and try to kill him for converting to Islam. Why a self and Islam boasting Muslim like Kabir Suman is not following <em>Sunna</em> with <em>Hena</em> coloured long beard, skull cap, pant above ankle joint and a full Arabic name like '<em>Something bin-something</em>'?</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2014/11-19-kabir-suman-neither-a-kabir-nor-has-a-suman">Read more...</a></p>
