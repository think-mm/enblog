<p>Recently there has been a lot of media uproar on the claim that the United States of America was unfair to the Muslims and discriminated against them. It is also claimed that the USA hated Muslims.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-27-is-america-unfair-to-muslims">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 11 October 2015</p>
<p>India's beef ban came into spotlight recently in horrible ways. On September 30, 2015, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34398433">a mob of more than 100 people lynched a 50 years old Muslim man</a>, named Mohammad Akhlaq, in Uttar Pradesh. They also roughed up his family, including seriously injuring his 22 years old son. What was the reason? There was a rumor that the family had beef in their fridge. On October 8, 2015, <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/969439/lawmaker-beaten-up-for-hosting-beef-party-in-indian-kashmir/">an MLA of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, named Engineer Rashid, was beaten up by some of his colleagues</a> for hosting a party where beef was served. On October 9, 2015, <a href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/india-beef-controversy-fresh-violence-uttar-pradesh-over-rumours-cow-slaughter-1523320">a mob beat up two youths and clashed with the police</a> in Uttar Pradesh. What was the problem there? There was a rumor that a cow was slaughtered and skinned.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/10-12-the-shame-of-ban-on-beef-in-secular-india">Read more...</a></p>

<p>&quot;Who attacked the teachers - Chhatra League boys? Not really, they are students, our students. What do they understand at this tender age? They understand whatever you teach them.&quot; <a href="https://primenews.com.bd/en/?p=18538">so says Professor Zafar Iqbal</a>. &quot;What's their fault? I really feel sad for them. This is a kind of injustice. Punishment should be given to those who have sent these boys.&quot; continues Professor Iqbal.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/09-10-the-non-accountability-syndrome-of-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>It is a remarkable visit indeed. Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, is visiting Bangladesh. Mr. Modi is arguably the most powerful Prime Minister of the India that the British colonial rulers created in 1947. His host is Sheikh Hasina, who is arguably the most powerful Prime Minister of the Bangladesh that was the eastern wing of Pakistan until 1971. Of course, with two parts at the east and west sides of India, Pakistan was the other country that the British created in 1947 in what is still known as the Indian subcontinent.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/06-06-an-outstanding-visitor-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>&quot;We don't want to be seen as atheists.&quot; So says Sajeeb Wajed, the son and special advisor of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Free-thinker Ananta Bijoy Das is brutally murdered. Professor Jafor Iqbal is persona non grata in Sylhet, so says Awami League. Malaysia and Thailand turn away desperate boat people at sea; and most of those people are Bangladeshis. Saudi Arabia is to hire 30,000 women from Bangladesh. Libya bans Bangladeshi workers.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/05-19-humanity-in-peril-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>This is with my sense of disgust that the molested women and their families must have felt in the Bangla New Year's day at the Dhaka University campus. I am so frustrated about Bangladesh that I feel like not talking about it at all, like I wish I was not born there.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/04-21-the-nation-of-abject-irresponsibility">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 1 April 2015</p>
<p>Bangalee Muslims are all simple and straight people. They are not communal (the commonly used word for &quot;religious-sectarian&quot; in the Indian subcontinent), do not care for fundamentalism, and are not religiously blind. Whatever (bad) things happen (to them), they happen due to the American conspiracies or the British divide-and-rule policy. They (the Americans and the British) do all these things by luring the straight and simple Bangalee Muslims. Bangalee Muslims are as simple as the babies. They have no fault, nor do they have much virtue. They cannot differentiate between good and bad.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/04-02-bangalee-muslims-by-washiqur-babu">Read more...</a></p>

<p>While I have to acknowledge that I am not the first to use the phrase, &quot;I am Avijit&quot;, when I say it, it is not a mere slogan for me. As I use this phrase, I mean real solidarity with what Dr. Avijit Roy stood for; and in one word, it is &quot;Humanity.&quot;</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-27-i-am-avijit-not-charlie-not-farkhunda">Read more...</a></p>

<p>While I generally do not criticize any religious book, the generalized title &quot;Why I Do Not Criticize Religious Books&quot;, would be inappropriate for this article. How is that? The answer would be that I have two major reasons for not criticizing the Quran, but only one major reason for not criticizing the Bible, the Gita, etc. These reasons are the topics of this article.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-09-why-i-do-not-criticize-the-quran">Read more...</a></p>
