    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 3 April 2013</p>
<p>In a poor country called Bangladesh, recently there has been a surge in heated talk and violent lawlessness. The principal driving forces behind these are the Islamist political parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami, Hifazat-e-Islami and Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-03-appeasing-the-islamists-an-distressing-sign-for-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 1 April 2013</p>
<p>Recently I had a chance to visit a small <em>Vaishnavite</em> (a sect under Hinduism) holy place in Uttar Pradesh, India. I was a guest of a known <em>Vaishnavite</em> devotee there. I enjoyed my hard earned holidays for a couple of days by sleeping and reading the books as internet connectivity was extremely poor to keep me in touch with the world outside. Television was also a big 'no'. The foods served were strictly vegetarian which I did not mind for few a few days.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-01-my-god-is-best-why-to-make-a-fool-out-of-you">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Saturday, 23 March 2013</p>
<p>In a central Myanmar town, the local Buddhist mobs have set fire to homes and mosques of Muslims two days back leaving at least 20 people dead and about 6000 homeless. The President of the country has declared a state of emergency in and around the riot ridden town. The attacks on Muslims by Buddhist hardliners have been occurring off and on in Myanmar since some time. The new found democracy in the country after about fifty years of military rule is facing tuff challenge to maintain law and order. This recent violent atrocity against Muslims in Myanmar reminds last year's brutalities by Buddhists against Rohingya Muslims of the country.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-23-attack-on-muslims">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 15 March 2013</p>
<p>Bangladesh National Party (BNP) was formed as result of power hungry Ziaur Rahman's dream of becoming the &quot;liberator of Bangladesh&quot; and replace Mujib in the history of Bangladesh. To achieve that objective, connivance with <em>Jamaat, Razakar, Albadr</em> and Bangladeshi radical <em>Ullema</em> was a compulsion of Ziaur Rahman. After liberation of Bangladesh, Pakistani ISI was looking an entry point to control Bangladesh. In BNP-<em>Jamaat</em> combination it found the best ally.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-15-maududi-jamaat-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>BNP Chief Ms Khaleda (leader of opposition) declined to meet the President of India during the latter's state visit to Bangladesh this week. Such behavior on the part of Ms Khaleda not only speaks volumes about her political compulsion, but also gives her true face as fountain head of <em>Jamaat</em>.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-07-bnp-jamaat-will-they-hear">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The movement that was started by a group of Bangladeshi youth at the Shahbag intersection in Dhaka on February 5, 2013, has grown tremendously. Initially there was just one podium in Shahbag. Now the youth all over the country have erected &quot;Gonojagoran Manchas&quot; (people's awakening podiums) in almost every sub-district of the country. The youth, led by internet savvy bloggers, have been joined by millions of ordinary people. The movement has been praised by noted intellectuals. It has also been supported by the government, even when the youth did not allow leaders of the governing political party to speak from their &quot;Gonojagoran Manchas.&quot; The youth movement has now turned into a people's movement, and it has been coined as 'Spirit of 1971' by a section of the Bangladeshi intelligentsia/media.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-07-the-spirits-of-1971-and-2013">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 1 March 2013</p>
<p>Bangladesh is in turmoil. Shahbag has taken a conscious stand in favour of capital punishment for the main war criminals. In doing so it has come in direct conflict with <em>Jamaat</em>. <em>Jamaat</em> and its student wing have been fighting for amalgamation of religion and state. That is why they were against the liberation of Bangladesh and tried to cripple the liberation war by unlashing all types of major criminal activities. From Islamic point of view they were and are correct. On the other hand, Shahbad represents a policy to separate religion and state. Shahbag is correct from the present international socio-political perspective as much water has flown down the Buriganga in past 14 hundred years.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/03-01-second-liberation-war">Read more...</a></p>
