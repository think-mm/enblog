    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 18 November 2013</p>
<p>Bangladesh, now just one month short of 42, has come a long way from the heady days of 1971 in trials and tribulations of nationhood. By any standards, this is a considerable period of time - long enough to establish its national identity, to position itself in the comity of nations and chart out its future course of action. But yet for some inexplicable reasons Bangladesh seems to be falling apart on each of these accounts.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/11-18-in-search-of-national-identity">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 31 October 2013</p>
<p>Human rights issues may be the despised terms to some prejudiced sections of the society or even to some despicable sovereign States of the world, but human rights epitomises what is good in human conscience, what constitutes inalienable rights of human beings and above all it highlights the sheer value of humanity. Without human rights, human beings would be no better than two-legged human animals, particularly in the modern society where money speaks louder than anything else and might is proclaimed to be the absolute right!</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/10-31-flagrant-violation-of-human-rights">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 22 October 2013</p>
<p>When Muslims think or talk about the prophet of Islam, they accept <em>apriori</em> that his prophet-hood was true and absolute. The system of 'prophet-hood' had been in the culture of Middle-East Asia in earlier days. If we look at the history of the area, it becomes clear that barring aside the accepted list of prophets starting from Adam (mythical to me), there had been a long list of claimants of prophet-hood who were not accepted as prophets by the large main stream population of the time and place. Even during the time of prophet of Islam, there were at least five other prophet-hood claimants. Judaism and Christianity also had their share of such claimants. Among all such claimants, only a few (including Mohammad) succeeded while the rest of vast majority failed. This success or failure had nothing to do with truth or falsity of prophet. It was something like modern day election campaign. Ultimately one would win in one time and place. The false and, at times, impossible promises made by today's politicians to be-fool people and win election were similarly used by the prospective prophets of old time to get public recognition and acceptance of his prophet-hood. Islamic 'paradise' is one such false promise. It was ultimately the survival of the fittest (not the best) prophet claimant. There was nothing divine about it.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/10-22-prophet-hood-in-islam-allah">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 24 September 2013</p>
<p><em>Jamaat-Shibir</em> has been fighting to impose <em>Sharia</em> in Bangladesh as a first step to recreate old 'golden period' of <em>Ummah</em> in near future under a Caliph. This calls for a relook into a few aspects of Islamic history to find out if the endeavor of <em>Jamaat-Shibir</em> is justified or not.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/09-24-a-few-questions-to-jamaat-shibir">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 29 August 2013</p>
<p>A big proportion of educated Muslims in Bangladesh read Qur'an without knowing the meaning and background of the verses. As true Muslims, they just believe that Qur'an contains the words of Allah (which is the highest knowledge of the world) and also includes science and miracle. They just believe whatever the <em>Alim</em> tells them about Qur'an. And why an <em>Alim</em> should dilute the absolute importance of Qur'an from where all his authority comes? So Qur'an is sacrosanct to vast majority of Bangladeshi Muslims (many educated and all uneducated) without being understood at all.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/08-29-bangladesh-dar-al-islam-vs-dar-al-insaan">Read more...</a></p>

<p>I felt deeply sad learning this morning that Dr. A. H. Jaffor Ullah died last night while in a coma. I got the news from <a href="https://blog.muktomona.com/?p=37056">Dr. Avijit Roy via his postings in the mukto-mona Bangla blog</a>, in the mukto-mona forum, and on his Facebook page. After learning that he was a personal friend of mine, Dr. Roy, the founder and moderator of mukto-mona, asked me if I could write a piece on Dr. Ullah in the mukto-mona English blog.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/08-24-abul-hasnat-jaffor-ullah-a-remarkable-free-thinker">Read more...</a></p>

<p>All the famous statements and arguments of Allama Iqbal and M A Jinnah justifying the 'Two Nation Theory' have been proved to be wrong. Had they been alive now, they would have found that their prophecies and convictions about the future of Pakistan (and inadvertently Bangladesh) have been utter disasters.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/07-24-quo-vadis-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Thursday, 27 June 2013</p>
<p>There is a book originally written in Urdu by Maulana Abdus Sattar and later translated in Bangla by Mustafa Haroon. The Bangla version was published by Islamic Foundation Bangladesh during 1980. This Bangla book is entitled &quot;<em>Aliya Madrasar Itihash</em>&quot;.  Abdus Sattar, in all probability, was an Urdu speaking East Pakistani. The original Urdu book was possibly written during Pakistan era of Bangladesh. In the narration of Bangla &quot;<em>Aliya Madrasar Itihash</em>&quot;, it becomes clear that the concept of &quot;Muslims are separate nation&quot; was very much apparent even in mid-nineteenth century India. It is fact that in the minority Muslim ruled India, this was not an issue. But after 1857, the non-Bengalee Muslim aristocrats suddenly found themselves as a faceless and stateless population. The sentiment percolated to poor Muslims of Bengal without any socio-economic reason which was relevant to their aristocrat non-Bengalee brothers only. The poor Muslims of Bengal simply fell in line on religious ground only.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/06-27-identity-crisis-the-main-cause-of-unhealthy-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p><b><span style="font-family: 'Bell MT','serif'">Bangladesh is severely ill today; it needs proper treatment, which makes concerned people worried. I am surely concerned about the future of the country. The future of a country depends on the success and failure of her citizens. The people of Bangladesh abroad work very hard, and many of them are successful. A part of their hard earned money abroad flows back to Bangladesh, which keeps the country afloat. Today, Garments Industries are flourishing. But, political turmoil and corruption have been always a threat to this industry. <span> </span></span></b></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/06-24-unhealthy-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>
