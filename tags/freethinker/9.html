<p>Bangalee Muslims are all simple and straight people. They are not communal (the commonly used word for &quot;religious-sectarian&quot; in the Indian subcontinent), do not care for fundamentalism, and are not religiously blind. Whatever (bad) things happen (to them), they happen due to the American conspiracies or the British divide-and-rule policy. They (the Americans and the British) do all these things by luring the straight and simple Bangalee Muslims. Bangalee Muslims are as simple as the babies. They have no fault, nor do they have much virtue. They cannot differentiate between good and bad.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/04-02-bangalee-muslims-by-washiqur-babu">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 31 March 2015</p>
<p>Within five weeks of murder of Avijit Roy, another secular blogger has been hacked to death in the broad day light on a busy street of Dhaka yesterday (30.03.2015). This time it was 26 years old Washikur Rahman. Interestingly, the assailants were three machetes wielding Islamists. It was a rerun of Avijit's murder with only difference that two of the three assailants were arrested. One of the two arrested assailants, 20 years old Jikrullah, a Madrassa student from Chittagong, told that the blogger has humiliated his Prophet.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-31-another-bangladeshi-blogger-murdered">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The world of Islam is in a state of turmoil. Radicalised Muslims and their misdemeanours are rarely out of media spotlight these days and rightly so. From the earth shattering event of 9/11 in New York in 2001 and the London Underground bombing in 2005 to al-Qaeda activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and in many other places; the atrocities of the so-called Islamic State (IS) in beheading countless innocent people in Syria and Iraq; Boko Haram's kidnapping and killing of school children in Nigeria, killing of Charlie Hebdo employees in France; killing of 23 tourists in the Bardo museum in Tunis by the IS affiliate groups and many, many more atrocities; all point to the grim reality that there is something fundamentally wrong with these radicalised Muslims and their monstrous mentality. These people are just not in harmony with the modern times and they fail to uphold human values.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-28-does-islam-need-reforming">Read more...</a></p>

<p>March 26th marks one month from the date my husband, Avijit Roy, and I were brutally attacked on the Dhaka University campus. Avijit wrote about science and humanity, critiqued religious fundamentalism, and created the first online Bangla platform for Freethinking. For these reasons, religious extremists hacked Avijit to death with machetes. The attack occurred in a crowded place with dozens of eyewitnesses, surveillance cameras, and police checkpoints. An Islamist terrorist group, &quot;Ansarullah Bangla-7&quot; has even claimed responsibility on social media for the attack. Despite all these leads, the only progress that has been made after one month of investigation is a seemingly tangential arrest.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-26-urge-the-bangladeshi-government-to-speak-up-and-pursue-a-thorough-investigation">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Washington, DC  - On March 21, 2015, about 100 Bangladeshi-Americans, human rights advocates, and interfaith leaders gathered in Dupont Circle to highlight the recent murder of a humanist writer. The rally, titled &quot;Standing with Avijit&quot; responded to the February 26 murder of Bangladeshi-American writer/blogger Avijit Roy by religious extremists in Dhaka.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-26-dozens-attend-standing-with-avijit-rally-in-washington-dc-32115">Read more...</a></p>

<p>By now you may have come to know that the founder and one of the moderators of Mukto-Mona blog Dr. Avijit Roy was brutally attacked and hacked to death on 26<sup>th</sup> February, 2015 in Bangladesh. His visit to Dhaka was primarily to spend time with his ailing mother. However, it was just natural that while there, he would attend Ekushey Boimela (the month-long national book fair held every year in February commemorating the 1952 Bangla language movement). He had two books published this year – &quot;<i>Victoria Ocampo</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>Shunno Theke Mohabissho</i>&quot; (<i>From Zero to Infinity</i>) co-authored by Dr. Mizan Rahman.  Both have been well received by readers and critics.  He longed for a chance to meet and greet friends and readers in a cordial atmosphere and Ekushey Boimela was indeed a unique opportunity for him.  Understandably, he was enjoying a great time in the book fair.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-12-victory-is-inevitable">Read more...</a></p>

<p>While I generally do not criticize any religious book, the generalized title &quot;Why I Do Not Criticize Religious Books&quot;, would be inappropriate for this article. How is that? The answer would be that I have two major reasons for not criticizing the Quran, but only one major reason for not criticizing the Bible, the Gita, etc. These reasons are the topics of this article.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-09-why-i-do-not-criticize-the-quran">Read more...</a></p>

<p>If you ask 'us' who was Avijit Roy, we say that he was a true 'Mukto Mona'. If you ask 'them' the same question the reply will be that he was anti-Islam. So, from 'their' perspective Islamic (?) Republic of Bangladesh does not have any moral authority to punish the assassins of Avijit. To them, Avijit's murder was necessary to save Islam and hence the murder was unlike other criminal activity. To us, the actions (or inactions) of Bangladesh government following the murder of Avijit tell loud and clear that Islamists have dominant power in the country.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-09-our-avijit-their-avijit-and-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>
