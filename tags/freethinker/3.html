<p>Like every other Bangladeshi kid, I also had to study Islamic religion throughout my high school years while my Hindu friends were studying Hindu religion. The Christian boy of the class Bobby Di Costa was the only exception as the school didn't have a Christian teacher.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/11-17-a-violation-of-child-rights">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Recently on Facebook, Taslima Nasrin, our own icon of freedom, accused several Bangladeshi Newspaper editors of being cowardly for refusing the publication of an article written to commemorate the tragic murder of the Jordanian satirist and writer Nahid Hattar. I can honestly feel Miss Nasrin's frustration, but however, I personally do not think it is appropriate to hold the editors or the journalists responsible for the appalling state of free speech Bangladeshi writers and freethinkers are suffering from.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/10-27-time-to-take-stand-in-defense-of-free-speech">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Thanks to Freedom from Religion Foundation for the Forward Award. Thanks for being a partner at this critical time, helping the freethinkers in Bangladesh from half the world away. Let me introduce myself first and then I will come to the situation in Bangladesh.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/10-20-bonya-receives-freedom-from-religion-foundations-forward-award-2016">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 25 September 2016</p>
<p>I do not know – how many people, who watched the Democratic National Committee (DNC) convention in Philadelphia, noticed resounding boos… from the diehard Bernie-supporters at the moment Bernie endorsed Hillary for President. So, it was clear that Bernie supporters were disappointed with him for his public endorsement of Hillary Clinton. On the other hand, Ted Cruz was also showered with boos in the Republican convention at Cleveland, Ohio; that was for not endorsing the front runner, Mr. Trump. So, these two boos are for two different reasons. Most diehard democrats and republicans may have missed these moments, but, it was a striking moment for me.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/09-26-take-home-messages-of-the-recent-political-conventions-in-usa">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 11 September 2016</p>
<p>It is almost universally accepted by the Muslims, but not necessarily by all 100 per cent of Muslims, that every bit of Islamic teaching in the form of verses, as depicted in the Holy Quran, is the direct message from the all powerful, omnipresent, omniscient Allah through His messenger Prophet Mohammad (pbuh). As these teachings are direct revelations from Allah, they are the absolute and ultimate truth and nothing can or should be done ever to change or reform these revelations. That is why Islam remains frozen for the last 1400 years or so.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/09-11-history-of-hajj">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 3 August 2016</p>
<p>In Bangladesh, a climate of fear has engulfed the secular activists of the country with the advent of a radical Islamist group. Known under the name of &quot;Ansarullah Bangla Team,&quot; its members are believed to be highly engaged in social media and also tech-savvy. Over the past few years, this youth-oriented radical Islamist group stole global media attention after successfully carrying out some fatal attacks on prominent secular activists, bloggers, writers, and publishers.  Contrary to ISIS, so far ABT has been meticulous in choosing their targets. ABT has even condemned the atrocities committed by ISIS, standing from its self-defined higher moral ground.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/08-03-ansarullah-bangla-team-genesis-and-beyond">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 26 July 2016</p>
<p>Mukto-Mona founder and author Avijit Roy's father Ajay Roy; a former university teacher was interviewed by TV journalist Farzana Rupa. The interview was broadcasted on Channel 71 on June 21<sup>st</sup>, 2015. Two days before the interview, in a separate interview with Bangla Tribune, Ajay Roy mentioned the names of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) teacher Farseem Mannan Mohammadey and his group, &quot;Zero to Infinity,&quot; also the team's advisor Jamat-e-Islami activist Trivuz Alam. First and foremost, Ajay explicitly mentioned that he doesn't necessarily believe that Farseem was involved in Avijit's killing. However, Farseem may have played an indirect role in preparing the field for the attack. He also mentioned that the same night Avijit Roy was murdered, &quot;Zero to Infinity&quot; advisor Trivuz Alam celebrated 'one major occasion' at the Radisson Hotel.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/07-26-who-is-the-mastermind-behind-avijits-murder">Read more...</a></p>
