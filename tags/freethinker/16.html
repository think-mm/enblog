    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 19 June 2013</p>
<p>There was a time when many Bengalees sincerely believed that Mamata Banerjee was the only hope against the perpetual tyranny of Commi parties in West Bengal state of India. She represented courage, sincerity, strength and determination to be with the people in their fight against the injustice of Commi parties. These Commi parties took the people for granted. They implemented Panchayati Raj as it could be used as a tool for social control in vote-based politics of India. The objective of their 'land reform' activities was also the same. They taught serving employees (both in public &amp; private sector) how not to work and constantly agitate against senior officials or management. They brought politics in every sphere of social and administrative matter. They maintained a huge body of goons from village to state capital to bull dodge any discontent or opposition. Use of muscle power, harassing people and even killing political opponents was common place in 34 years of Commi rule in the state.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/06-19-poribartan-in-west-bengal">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 19 May 2013</p>
<p>A book entitled &quot;Islam Dismantled&quot;, written by Sujit Das, was published in 2012. In the book Sujit has portrayed Muhammad as a narcissist. He did so by examining and interpreting the information about the life and conducts of Muhammad available in Qur'an, <em>Hadith </em>and other sources <em>vis-à-vis</em> information about narcissism/narcissists available in different sources. The book in question was thought provoking. However, it is natural that no Muslim will like such adverse ('blasphemous' in Islam) remark about the prophet.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/05-19-islam-dismantled-dismantling-sujit-das">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 6 May 2013</p>
<p>Blasphemy in Islam has no reference in Qur'an and <em>Hadith</em>. This is a later creation of Jurists (<em>Ulema</em>). The <em>Ulema</em> are a power hungry lot. They exert authority on all aspects of Muslims' lives. Combination of politicians with <em>Ulema</em> in the issue of blasphemy law is deadly. Why a religion needs stringent blasphemy law to protect it and its Prophet?  It surely does not. But, in the name of protecting Islam and Prophet, the <em>Ulema</em>-politician combination is actually protecting their authoritative and political position.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/05-06-blasphemy-law-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The latest news from Savar, Bangladesh, as found in the Daily Star at 6:00 AM US Eastern DST on May 15, 2013, is that 1115 dead bodies have been recovered from the debris of a collapsed eight-story building, and 12 people died in the hospitals after being rescued alive (1). While 2,438 people have been pulled alive, at the end of the rescue operation the number of victims unaccounted for remains uncertain. (While this blog was originally written on April 26, 2013, the casualty figures in this paragraph have been updated on May 15, 2013.)</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-26-the-savar-tragedy-a-horrific-flare-up-of-a-national-disease-of-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The right to express one's opinion freely is maybe the most important democratic right, and it is currently under assault in Bangladesh. Hifazat-e-Islam demands the introduction of strict blasphemy laws, and the government, instead of defending freedom, resorts to an ill-advised and imprudent appeasement strategy that hinders the press in its duty to inform the public, threatens the futures of young bloggers who were, and continue to be, arrested, and puts in peril the future of the democracy of the country.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-23-blasphemy-and-the-right-to-offend">Read more...</a></p>

<p>In one of the more remarkable recent attacks on non-Muslims in Bangladesh, a 200 years old Hindu temple was burned down by Muslim criminals. According to a Daily Star report on April 20, 2013, the month of March, 2013, saw 94 attacks on Hindu temples in various districts of Bangladesh. <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/march-saw-94-attacks/">https://www.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/march-saw-94-attacks/</a></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-22-non-muslims-in-bangladesh-what-choices-do-they-have">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Why are there so many infidels in our country? Almighty <em>Allah</em> had asked us to do <em>Jihad</em> some fourteen hundred years ago. What we have been doing so long? <em>Jihad</em> is the main obligation of all Muslims. Kill the infidels. <em>Jihad</em> is a holy terror approved by Islam. We have pure Islamic blood, we are the best and we will establish <em>Sariah</em> in Bangladesh: <em>Insallah</em>. What is this &quot;<em>Amar Sonar Bangla…</em>&quot;? This is a Hindu song. Hindus are not the only infidels in Bangladesh. There are others like Christians, Buddhists, poets, intellectuals, rationalists and free thinkers who advocate Bengali culture in the form of Hindu &quot;<em>Poila Baishakh</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>Robindra Sangeet</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Nazrul Geeti</em>&quot; etc.. Many of their earlier generation were killed by our Islamic Pakistani brothers in 1971.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-12-an-imaginary-hifajat-i-islam-speech-somewhere-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The government of Bangladesh has clearly demonstrated that the arrest of three bloggers, Subrata Adhikary Shuvo, Russell Parvez, and Mashiur Rahman Biplob, on April 1, 2013, was no April Fool joke. Bangladesh police also arrested another blogger, Asif Mohiuddin, two days later. What was the reason? The four arrested young men have been alleged to have hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslims of Bangladesh. There are no specifics in the news media as to what exactly they wrote in their blogs that hurt the religious sentiments of the Muslims.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-11-the-hatred-of-protecting-islam-must-stop">Read more...</a></p>

<p>When we talk about weapons of mass destruction, we think of missiles, bombs, nuclear explosions. When we talk about greatest or most destructive innovation by human kind, we talk about atom bombs. But the fact remains; the most destructive force was invented by humans, in very early age of their evolution. Men made knives, turned them to daggers and then moved on to guns and then missiles. All of them were weapons and in different phase of human evolution, these weapons were perfected and used for good or evil purposes. Men also invented Gods, then rituals and then religion. In different stages of evolution, they endorsed different forms of religions and effectively used it for good and evil. At this cutting-edge phase of human history, religion has lost most of it's purposes, those who were once considered the sole meaning of life. Still religion remains an incomparable, invincible, transcending weapon for one group of people, those who want to rule with fear and those who want to rule the foresighted, with the support from the oblivious.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2013/04-05-the-religion-of-politics">Read more...</a></p>
