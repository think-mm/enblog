<p>In response to my very brief post (written in utmost grief) &quot;Chhi Chhi&quot; of 27th February 2015 in this blog following the gruesome murder of Avijit Roy, one Huseyin Rahmi Guner commented &quot; â€¦ <em>If anyone slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole humanity: and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole humanity.&quot; (Al-Qur'an 5:32)</em>.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-05-after-the-murder-of-avijit">Read more...</a></p>

<p><b>After learning about the threat stating that - he will be killed when he comes back to Bangladesh, I, immediately, called Avijit to remind him not to go back to Bangladesh ever. I also asked him to be extra careful while he is in the USA, and advised him to forward that threat-link to FBI. He assured me by saying - &quot;Don't worry, Jiten-da, I will be careful.&quot; I heard no intimidation, but carelessness, in his voice. So, I knew, he will not change anything in his life.</b></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-05-avijit-the-knight">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The title of this article could have been &quot;Why I Am Not a Hindu, or &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot;, etc.; replacing the word Muslim with the name of any other religious group. If I did not want to make the title sound negative, I could have made it something like &quot;Why I Am an Atheist.&quot; But since among the religions of the world, my least preference would be Islam, the religion of the Muslims, I thought the word &quot;Muslim&quot; would fit the title the best.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-02-why-i-am-not-a-muslim">Read more...</a></p>

<p>You already have been informed of the murder of Mr. Avijit Roy, writer and freethinker, by the barbaric attack of Islamist hardliners in Dhaka last week. For our international readers, necessary information on his work and career has already been and will be published by other writers in this website, therefore, I will not add any formal view of his life hereafter. This is for the first time I am writing in Muktomona, and it is a tribute, of course, to my hero - as I used to call him - Avijit da (brother).  I knew he would stop someday, but this early? Never I imagined. A sharp pang of sorrow has shot through me on hearing his premature passing away. I cried, I got agitated, but then I decided to speak out. I am writing for Avijit da, I am writing for letting those fanatics know that neither Avijit, nor his ideology is dead.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/03-01-avijit-da-we-are-still-writing">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 27 February 2015</p>
<p>Another most barbaric, most heinous crime had been committed by religious fanatics in the name of religion in full public view on the street of Dhaka. Dr. Avijit Kumar Roy, a Bioengineer presently working in software engineering in the USA, had been brutally murdered as he and his wife were going home at about 9:00 pm on Thursday, 26 February after attending the Ekushey Book Fair and launching his newly published books. They were attacked by two or three assailants with machetes. The Coroner of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital, only a short distance away from the crime scene, testified that the attack was an act of a professional killer. Two deep rooted stabs at the back of the skull were so severe that the victim died within a short time from severe bleeding. His wife had also been attacked and she is now in critical condition.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-28-brutality-of-religious-fanatics">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Yesterday, when my wife was reading news from Bangladesh on the internet, she told me that she was reading about the murder of Avijit Roy in Dhaka. I exclaimed to her, &quot;our Avijit?&quot;, got on to internet immediately, and started reading the news myself. I felt like I was having a nightmare, did not want to believe the news to be true.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-28-a-note-of-salute-to-avijit-roy">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Some brain-dead Islamist bigots have murdered Avijit in Dhaka yesterday. I have no word to condemn this heinous crime perpetuated by these Islamist cowards. When such Islamist cowards failed in intellectual discourse with avijit and when they found that their dogma has been proved hollow by Avijit, they settled the score by murdering him. I wish that these Islamist bigots should be put to some sort of genetic engineering process so that at least their progeny become 'HUMAN BEINGS' and not Islamist bigots.
<em>Chhi chhi</em>....
But the two murderers of Avijit only show the tip of ice berg. What humanity should do with millions of such brain-dead Islamists in Bangladesh?

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Sunday, 8 February 2015</p>
<p>Having observed unremitting political schism, egregious falsification and unbridled corruption by politicians of all shades of colour in Bangladesh for nearly four and half decades, time is now ripe to speak out loud and clear and point out the root cause of national malaise. This is not the country which once inspired and galvanised people of all strands of life to rise up against the repressive, brutal hegemony of Pakistan. People demanded democratic rights, cultural freedom, freedom of expression, and above all a free, fair and honest society where everybody irrespective of creed, colour and religion would live in peace and harmony. What they have got now is exactly the opposite of their demands. But probably people themselves have fundamentally changed and now demanding something else which was not what the country was created for.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/02-09-a-depraved-state">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Wednesday, 28 January 2015</p>
<p>In an obscure corner of Russia, a local court banned &quot;Geeta&quot; (the famous Hindu Religious Book) last year for being a book which describes and promotes violence. The members of RSS and similar Hindu organizations in India became vocal with protests against that court verdict. But as the said court was far away, Indian Hindu bigots could not engage in violent activities on that issue. Obviously, many Hindus felt hurt for labeling Geeta as a book of violence.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/01-28-the-geeta-and-violence">Read more...</a></p>

<p><strong>{<strong>Postscript from the Author (January 27, 2015):</strong> It is a great disappointment that in spite of the initial consent by the Prime Minister and approval by the Speaker, there was actually no Saraswati Puja at the Bangladesh Parliament. I am not sure why the big leaders' approvals were not implemented. But there is no doubt that this reneging pleases and supports the Islamic/Muslim hate-mongers of Bangladesh.}</strong></p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/01-20-saraswati-puja-at-bangladesh-parliament-it-is-progress-indeed">Read more...</a></p>
