    <p class="post-meta">Published on Friday, 18 March 2016</p>
<p>The Muslim world is now in utter chaotic and fragmented state both economically and politically after nearly 1400 years of its existence. The cause of its problem lies not so much in its disharmony with the present world but in the very modality of its existence. As the last of the three monotheistic religions (Judaism and Christianity being the other two), it came into existence as the last and final religion proclaiming the ultimate truth from the Creator, the Almighty God. The message was final and nothing could replace it. Whereas other religions kept pace with time and space and evolved (albeit reluctantly) with scientific development and knowledge, Islam steadfastly refused to reform itself. It is indeed utterly constrained by its own proclamation of finality and thereby invariant to changes.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2016/03-18-regressive-islam">Read more...</a></p>

<p>Today, on the eve of 26th February, the day Avijit was murdered last year by Islamists, the very thought that haunted me last year is haunting me again this year - why Avijt made that dreadful trip to Bangladesh, knowing full well that a death threat hangs on his neck.

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Tuesday, 29 December 2015</p>
<p>It is extremely sad and distressing to observe that the liberation war fatality figure has become a political ping-pong game between the two political parties. It had been purposely turned by the vested interests into a test of patriotism! If anyone expresses any scepticism on the fatality figure of three million, then he or she is scorned as anti-Bangladeshi, pro-Pakistani, pro-BNP etc. person and even as a traitor by the ruling party propagandists. On the other hand, even politely listening to 3 million fatality figure in an objective fashion is considered as irrational kowtowing by the vested interests.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-30-war-dead-has-became-a-political-game">Read more...</a></p>

<p>[fusion_text]It may be very tempting and, indeed, flattering when a super rich country like Saudi Arabia requests a country like Bangladesh to participate, almost as equal, in the Islamic coalition against terrorism to fight the menace of the Islamic State (IS). Bangladesh may be painted by the vested quarters as a strong and sufficiently grown up in stature among the Islamic nations to be part of a collective action against the evil outfit of IS (also known as ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant)). But this image of empowerment is illusory, misleading and could be potentially harmful.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-17-bangladesh-must-shun-the-religious-proxy-war-2">Read more...</a></p>

    <p class="post-meta">Published on Monday, 30 November 2015</p>
<p>Halloween or Hallowe'en, a contraction of all Hallows' Evening, is a celebration brought to the USA by the Irish and Scottish immigrants in 19th century. In the late 20th century this celebration of Halloween was also observed in other western countries. Now, in the present time Halloween is celebrated in almost all the western countries namely, USA, Canada, Ireland, UK, and many other countries. Other than the countries mentioned earlier it is observed being celebrated in countries like Japan in Asia, as well as in Australia and New Zealand. According to the popular belief among the people of Irish, British Welsh community, the pagan god of death Samhain (SAH-win) calls upon all the souls/ spirits of the dead people. According to the belief, in that night all the man made laws are no longer active and the dead spirits are allowed to join the world of alive world. They also believed that, all the dead spirits lived in a land in the form of immortal youngs, and were called &quot;Tir nan Oge&quot;. Some believed that the dead ones lived with angels.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/12-01-halloween-in-bangladesh">Read more...</a></p>

<p>The world is undoubtedly at a critical juncture dealing with the grotesque violence of the ISIL/IS. The IS are hell bent on punishing the West for attacking their occupied lands in Iraq and Syria and the West want to put an end to the IS barbarity and have declared war on them in retribution to Paris atrocity.</p>        <p class="small"><a href="/posts/2015/11-19-root-causes-of-grotesque-islamic-violence">Read more...</a></p>
